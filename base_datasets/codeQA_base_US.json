I'm working on a **[YOUR OPERATING SYSTEM]** computer.!@top@! \n\n**Please generate the following Python code:**\n\n1. **Import necessary libraries:**\n   - Import Flask for web framework functionality.\n   - Import a suitable library for accessing a database of recipes. You can choose from options like `sqlite3`, `MySQLdb`, or `psycopg2`, depending on the database you plan to use.\n   - Import any additional libraries needed for data manipulation or user interface elements.\n\n2. **Define a Flask application:**\n   - Create a Flask app instance.\n   - Configure the app with necessary settings (e.g., template directory, secret key).\n\n3. **Create a database connection:**\n   - Establish a connection to the database using the imported library.\n   - Create a table to store recipes if it doesn't exist, including columns for:\n     - Recipe name\n     - Ingredients (consider using a list or a comma-separated string)\n     - Instructions\n     - Optional: Recipe image URL, cooking time, difficulty level.\n\n4. **Define routes for the app:**\n   - **Homepage:**\n     - Display a form for users to enter search terms (ingredients).\n   - **Search results page:**\n     - Retrieve recipes from the database that match the search query.\n     - Display the results in a list format, showing:\n       - Recipe name\n       - First few ingredients\n       - Optionally, recipe image (if available).\n   - **Recipe detail page:**\n     - Show the full details of a selected recipe, including:\n       - Recipe name\n       - Full list of ingredients\n       - Instructions\n       - Optional: Image, cooking time, difficulty level.\n!@middle@!\n5. **Implement search functionality:**\n   - Use the imported database library to query the database based on the user's search terms.\n   - Filter recipes based on the presence of the entered ingredients in their list.\n\n6. **Create templates:**\n   - Create HTML templates for the homepage, search results page, and recipe detail page.\n   - Use Flask's templating engine (Jinja2) to dynamically render content from the Python code.\n\n**Please ensure the code:**\n\n- Adheres to best practices for Python code style and readability.\n- Includes comments to explain the purpose of each section of the code.\n- Uses clear and descriptive variable names.\n- Handles potential errors gracefully with appropriate error handling mechanisms.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n- The database should store a sample set of recipes for testing purposes.\n- The recipe data can be sourced from a public recipe dataset or manually created.\n- The application should run locally on the development server.\n\n**I'd appreciate it if you could provide:**\n\n- The complete Python code for the recipe app.\n- Any additional instructions or suggestions for running the app.\n!@bottom@!\n- Potential libraries or frameworks for extending the functionality of the app in the future (e.g., for user authentication, recipe rating, etc.).\n```",
