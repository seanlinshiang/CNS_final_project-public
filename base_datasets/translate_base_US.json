She\u2019d entered respite care while my father healed from a broken hip. Plucked from the routines of home, truth revealed itself in confusing behaviors and eventually a CT scan: both my parents had dementia. \\n\\nHe kept calling me from his room, which neighbored my mom\u2019s. He rang, 10, 12, 14 times a day he rang, screaming that something was wrong with her mind\u2014unaware in his own urgency that he\u2019d !@top@! already called. He\u2019d scream. Forget. Most everyone else he knew had blocked his number due to the hammering rate of angry calls. \\n\\n\u201cShe just sat in the dark all day,\u201d he pleaded. They wanted to go home. \\n\\n\u201cThe house isn\u2019t safe, Dad. We\u2019ve talked about this a thousand times,\u201d I told him. He had to remember. I was only starting to understand he couldn\u2019t. \\n\\nFor many, many years by then, my mother had lived mostly as a shut-in, able to walk but very unsteadily; my father used their home\u2019s three front porch steps to keep her indoors. (The flight of steps she climbed inside had no contraindication.) \\n\\n\u201cWe were so happy there,\u201d he told me miserably. \u201cWhen are you coming?\u201d\\n\\n\u201cAs soon as this lockdown is over,\u201d I promised. \\n\\n\u201cWhen the hell will that be?\u201d It was 2021, deep enough into the pandemic that we were vaccinated but still in the thick of outbreaks. I knew if I estimated a date for my arrival, and it changed, that would be the single thing his brain held onto: the fact that I\u2019d let him down.\\n\\n## I knew if I estimated a date for my arrival, and it changed, that would be the single thing his brain held onto: the fact that I\u2019d let him down.\\n\\nBut the lockdown did end, and I drove the hours cross-state, stopping to eat at a Chipotle. Weary already, that\u2019s where I got the news of professional success. A publisher wanted to make an offer on my first book. I couldn\u2019t wait to tell my mother in person.\\n\\nI\u2019d been working toward this for years, since girlhood really, when my mom bought me a word processor in middle school and taught me how to touch-type, making thought permanent. She taught me to type for the same reason she taught me to sew: she wanted me to have job skills. \\n\\nBut I was a kid with too much imagination and too many words I couldn\u2019t say aloud. I went along with her each Saturday to our empty Presbyterian church, where she cleaned bathrooms and swept floors while I skipped around playing make-believe. The job was a kindness. The preacher knew how little we had; he snuck Christmas gifts into our house in black garbage bags so my mother could wrap them. My favorite part was when she cleaned the sanctuary. As she plucked hard-candy wrappers from the nooks of the choir chancel and dusted the rows and rows of pews, I got to dance around the deep plush carpet in my socks. It was such a rebellion: Socks! In the sanctuary! When I wore myself out, I\u2019d tuck under a pew and daydream, watching for her legs as she moved through the vast room. When she got to where I\u2019d hidden, she\u2019d smile down at me as if I were a genuine surprise. Sweat dampened the temples of her hair, which would add extra spring as it dried. I\u2019d roll on my back and stare at the underside of the pew, picturing worlds in the knots of wood.\\n\\nMy writing habit started in third grade, when I wrote a story about a teenager who stole a diamond ring to pay off gambling debts. The teacher gently asked if I had copied the story from somewhere\u2014why should a kid my age know about bookies? We\u2019d lost our house the summer prior, after my father lost his job. He had been a bus driver and crashed the bus, drunk. He went away for a while\u2014jail or rehab, I don\u2019t know. In turn, I carried our cat around in a laundry basket and called him Dad. He was a quiet, fuzzy replacement. My easy transference to a feline father-figure distressed my mother though, and when my dad came home sober for a short time, she chose to believe it would last, even when it didn\u2019t. \\n\\nBy high school, I penned supernatural short stories and poetry about pain and anger. I jotted down words while locked in my room. The clatter of fingers on keys became a funnel for the noise in my mind and our home, a place to pin ideas while my father screamed. \\n\\nWhen I arrived at the nursing facility, my mother complimented me on my boots. She grinned and called me Sandy. That\u2019s my aunt\u2019s name, my dad\u2019s sister.\\n\\nI dropped my mask momentarily. \u201cIt\u2019s me, Sarah,\u201d I told her.\\n\\nShe studied me, shook her head. \u201cOh, it is.\u201d I wasn\u2019t convinced anything had clicked.\\n\\nI hugged her quickly, needing to make myself real to her but also worried I might transmit some COVID germ picked up at a rest stop. My hand reached for her hair. It looked foreign.\\n\\nHer hair had always been a stubborn mass of curls. A stylist once bothered to count fourteen cowlicks on her head, a bob that normally points every which way: up, left, front, back, under, through. Ever practical, for years she kept it in short corkscrews. Except after cancer, the decade prior, when she didn\u2019t lose her hair with chemo, she celebrated by letting it grow long and wild. To my children, she looked like a friendly witch. To me, the cloud of silver made her appear rapidly aged. Maybe the cancer did it. Maybe all the rest caught up with her.\\n\\nNow, at the nursing home, it was in odd, straight stalks. An aide must have tried to tame it, which looked like a failed revolution up there. Her hair, like her memory, had gone flat.\\n\\nI wheeled her to my father\u2019s room. He took a half-second to recognize me in my face mask but quickly started demanding help moving them home.\\n\\nMy mother studied her lap, then finally interjected, \u201cThis is my husband.\u201d\\n\\nDad guffawed. \u201cShe knows that, Lois! This is Sarah! Sarah! It\u2019s Sarah.\u201d He looked at me helplessly. \u201cWe have to get out of this place.\u201d\\n\\nI couldn\u2019t argue.\\n\\nI felt like I had no idea what I was doing coordinating their care from afar and was dogged by a sense that if all this had happened on a more natural timeline, I would manage better.\\n\\nMy mother had me at nearly 40. Is that your grandma? people asked me when I was a kid. It embarrassed us both, like she\u2019d achieved a Biblical-level miracle having me at that age.\\n\\nNow I was just past 40 myself. She had eclipsed 80, and my own kids were school-aged. A generation felt missing somewhere\u2014the one who was supposed to teach me how to mother while helping my own parents as they faded.\\n\\nTime twisted around inside me. I still didn\u2019t know how to rescue my mother, I didn\u2019t know how to rescue either of them.\\n\\nFamilies often follow patterns, and although it was too soon, it was my turn to start enacting my mother\u2019s roles. When her own mom had gotten too frail to live on her own, my mom had taken her in, giving her my childhood bedroom. I couldn\u2019t do the same with my parents\u2014I would not subject my children to formative years with my father in their space, his voice whipping lasting pathways into their minds. \\n\\nBut I also knew the current arrangement wasn\u2019t working. I\u2019d begun to buckle under the strain of my father\u2019s deterioration and my mom\u2019s mental drift. I didn\u2019t know how to shield my children from what I was feeling. \\n\\nI didn\u2019t know how to look beyond each brutal moment.\\n\\nMy mother could. It might have been the key to her survival.\\n\\n## I didn\u2019t know how to look beyond each brutal moment.My mother could. It might have been the key to her survival.\\n\\nI remember !@middle@! a time when she was in the kitchen popping popcorn and forgot to put the top on the popper. I heard her shriek and laugh, and I ran to the door to see kernels launching like missiles in all directions. Popcorn was all over the floor, the counters, shooting toward the living room, filling the air with a seemingly endless bounty. It caught in our hair, bounded off her shoulders, and she pealed with giggles. \\n\\nMy father exploded, Lois, you could break a wet dream! (one of his favorite insults), but that time, Mom and I doubled over laughing at the sheer anarchy of corn pelting him too as he yelled over the mess.\\n\\nI started trying to get my mom to move out back when I was in first or second grade. Sometimes she would threaten to leave, but he countered that he would track us down and set fire to wherever we went, with us inside. I was small, skittish, but fear motivated escape in me, while it rooted her in place. \\n\\nWhen she wouldn\u2019t leave, I decided to run away, but I was unsure of how to pack my cat into my suitcase. I couldn\u2019t leave without her, the cat. Or my mother. \\n\\nEach evening until I moved off for college, my father drunkenly slurred and screamed, chasing me around the house until I caged myself in my room and he pounded outside. I\u2019d stayed there safe, until his attention refocused on my mother, then I\u2019d run out and draw his anger toward me again. I was faster, could outrun him.\\n\\nHe had the longer-term benefit of blacking out, forgetting it all in the morning. When I was 21, with no one mentioning the irony, he got sober. He\u2019d \u201cblown up like a balloon,\u201d Mom said. An early user of Dr. Google, she diagnosed him with kidney or liver failure and told him he had two choices: dry up or he would die. She detoxed him at home.\\n\\nA couple of weeks into sobriety that would span the rest of his life, she called me at college and told me I could come home. He was \u201cbetter.\u201d \\n\\nWalking into the house, it was the usual old fog, dark memories laced within dense cigarette smoke. He sat in the same, filthy-brown recliner, feet kicked up, sipping Pepsi in a glass with ice. The TV blared as it always had. I stepped timidly into the living room, feeling as though the floor could drop away any moment, spilling me into all the other times he sat perched in that chair, weighing what might throw him into a rage. Look at you two eating. Pig, he\u2019d said to me, a hungry child. You\u2019re trying to starve me to death, he constantly accused my mother, though she cooked for him daily. He just wouldn\u2019t eat; his stomach had been saturated with booze. \\n\\nThat was before. The distant past, or at least two weeks prior to him quitting the drink. He smiled at me the first day I saw him sober, his dark eyes lighting up with the visit, then he turned back to the TV. Eventually, he drained his glass, and kicked down the footrest. That metallic clang, the slap of him bolting from the chair, clenched my stomach, my chest. I was habituated to run from the sound. He merely rushed off for more soda. I felt myself locked in fight or flight on the edge of the couch. Freeze, instead. Old terror doesn\u2019t look like anything much. No one noticed.\\n\\nLater, I\u2019d check the fridge and see beer cans left over. I counted them with every visit, but they sat untouched. Eventually, he gave them to neighbors. \\n\\nHe broke every rule of AA, and fair enough, it had never helped him before. This time, he was always around temptation and ascribed to no higher power (unless you count my mother). He kept up his daily appearance at the bar and even sat on the same barstool, sipping ginger ale. She maintained her routine of working only to scrape by with whatever he didn\u2019t spend gambling or on cigarettes, until she got him to quit smoking in their 60s. \\n\\n## We never talked about what a terror he\u2019d been. I assumed it all washed away as ginger ale replaced beer and whiskey.\\n\\n\\nGet the Longreads Top 5 Email\\nKickstart your weekend by getting the week\u2019s best reads, hand-picked and introduced by Longreads editors, delivered to your inbox every Friday morning.\\n\\nSign up now\\nWe lived that sober reality for two decades, though the smallest perceived infraction could still make him snap. \\n\\nBut as he screamed at me in his scared, elderly state that I needed to help them both, I remembered all the years at once. His raised voice collapsed the distance between my girl\u2019s body and my middle-aged one, bracing inside while my legs prepared to bolt.\\n\\nI was starting to wonder what my mom had retained\u2014and what was being lost, floating off like curls of smoke. \\n\\nIn my father\u2019s nursing home room, his walker next to the bed and my mom gazing vaguely in her wheelchair, I panicked. I said something I would forget moments later.\\n\\nIt\u2019s difficult to explain, but there\u2019s a willful blank space in my memory. I must have suggested they should live closer to me. I must have said the words, but there\u2019s a gap in conversation, a moment that vanished immediately in my stress and overwhelm. And then my dad was nodding, yes, my parents needed to move to a nice place near me, where I could help take care of them. A few incautious words evaporated all the years I\u2019d distanced myself from my childhood.\\n\\nWe never talked about what a terror he\u2019d been. I assumed it all washed away as ginger ale replaced beer and whiskey.\\n\\nI wheeled my mom back into her room, and soon she was in bed. She pointed at the window and told me about the pond outside.\\n\\nThere was no pond; just darkness. She told me about the ducks that lived out there, and I wanted to cry but couldn\u2019t because then she\u2019d know something was wrong. It was my job to protect her. She smiled sweetly and told me how the man across the hall kept one of those ducks in his room, would you believe it?\\n\\n\u201cRight under that tree.\u201d I looked through her open door to the Christmas tree in the room across the hall. \\n\\n\u201cI don\u2019t see a duck. Are you sure?\u201d I asked, hoping my doubt would cut through whatever gripped her. \\n\\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s right there.\u201d She poked a finger out from under her blanket. Her eyes locked on something I couldn\u2019t see. \\n\\n\u201cHmmm.\u201d I shrugged. She studied me\u2014looking but not yet seeing her duck. \u201cI love those boots, Sandy.\u201d\\n\\nDaggers in my heart.\\n\\nIt took weeks longer than my father wanted for me to find a suitable facility, get their Medicaid provider changed for the move to a new county. The minutiae of bureaucracy was beyond him. He only retained that I hadn\u2019t served his needs quite yet. \\n\\nMy book wound up going to auction. The result wasn\u2019t lavish, but a livable wage for a difficult book that investigated stories of abuse in evangelical church environments. It would be about brave women who spoke out against and fought the abuse. \\n\\nI had meant to mostly write from the outside, as an observer, but over time, snippets of personal narrative spilled in. I tried to be antiseptic and analyze how my own childhood abuse differed from those who endured spiritual abuse; they believed their suffering had been God\u2019s will after all. That stung in a unique way, I realized. Some people lived with pain that couldn\u2019t be explained; others were given false reasons and told to accept it. \\n\\nTapping my own story into the draft pulled old memories out of me, put them elsewhere, on a page. They lived alongside my sources\u2019 brutal recollections, footnoted to interviews, testimony, police and court records. There were far too many horrors I couldn\u2019t write. Those just lived in me, reawakening whenever I heard his voice. \\n\\n## There were far too many horrors I couldn\u2019t write. Those just lived in me, reawakening whenever I heard his voice.\\n\\nFinally, the weekend came to pack my parents\u2019 belongings into my SUV and my parents into my husband\u2019s little electric car. We found them dressed and ready in wheelchairs. \\n\\n\u201cAre you excited?\u201d I asked my mom. \\n\\n\u201cSure,\u201d she said. She did seem genuinely happy, ready for an adventure, or maybe just glad to be leaving the room. I had picked that place during an emergency\u2014surely the next round would go better. My husband was puttering around shoving a few last items into the cars. I absently grabbed a tiny, neon green comb from the sink and started running it through my mother\u2019s silver hair. It was clean. Whatever one aide had used to flatten her hair, another had cleared to return it to its !@bottom@! original state. \\n\\nMy hands moved absently, experienced. We were at a stage where I spent plenty of time dissecting my own daughter\u2019s tangles. If I didn\u2019t rake through it myself about once a week, she\u2019d clump a knot that quickly turned into a dreadlock that I\u2019d have to pull apart hair by hair. I knew I could just cut the knots out, make her learn a hard lesson about self-care. But she loved her long hair; I loved how it turned back into rippling silk. \\n\\nI ran the wide-toothed end of the plastic comb through my mom\u2019s curls one at a time, lightly, giving each a gentle run. My own waves would never tolerate this, would rapidly turn to frizz. Hers snapped back to coils just as they always had.\\n\\nSarah Stankorb is the author of the national best-seller Disobedient Women (Worthy Books\/Hachette).

Readers who are on the lookout for trigger warnings are advised to give Worm a pass.\\n\\n!@top@!\\n\\nClass ended in five minutes and all I could think was, an hour is too long for lunch.\\n\\nSince the start of the semester, I had been looking forward to the part of Mr. Gladly\u2019s World Issues class where we\u2019d start discussing capes.  Now that it had finally arrived, I couldn\u2019t focus.  I fidgeted, my pen moving from hand to hand, tapping, or absently drawing some figure in the corner of the page to join the other doodles.  My eyes were restless too, darting from the clock above the door to Mr. Gladly and back to the clock.  I wasn\u2019t picking up enough of his lesson to follow along.  Twenty minutes to twelve; five minutes left before class ended.\\n\\nHe was animated, clearly excited about what he was talking about, and for once, the class was listening.  He was the sort of teacher who tried to be friends with his students, the sort who went by \u201cMr. G\u201d instead of Mr. Gladly.  He liked to end class a little earlier than usual and chat with the popular kids, gave lots of group work so others could hang out with their friends in class, and had \u2018fun\u2019 assignments like mock trials.\\n\\nHe struck me as one of the \u2018popular\u2019 kids who had become a teacher.  He probably thought he was everyone\u2019s favorite.  I wondered how he\u2019d react if he heard my opinion on the subject.  Would it shatter his self image or would he shrug it off as an anomaly from the gloomy girl that never spoke up in class?\\n\\nI glanced over my shoulder.  Madison Clements sat two rows to my left and two seats back.  She saw me looking and smirked, her eyes narrowing, and I lowered my eyes to my notebook.  I tried to ignore the ugly, sour feeling that stewed in my stomach.  I glanced up at the clock.  Eleven-forty-three.\\n\\n\u201cLet me wrap up here,\u201d Mr. Gladly said, \u201cSorry, guys, but there is homework for the weekend.  Think about capes and how they\u2019ve impacted the world around you.  Make a list if you want, but it\u2019s not mandatory.  On Monday we\u2019ll break up into groups of four and see what group has the best list.  I\u2019ll buy the winning group treats from the vending machine.\u201d\\n\\nThere were a series of cheers, followed by the classroom devolving into noisy chaos.  The room was filled with sounds of binders snapping shut, textbooks and notebooks being slammed closed, chairs screeching on cheap tile and the dull roar of emerging conversation.  A bunch of the more social members of the class gathered around Mr. Gladly to chat.\\n\\nMe?  I just put my books away and kept quiet.  I\u2019d written down almost nothing in the way of notes; there were collections of doodles spreading across the page and numbers in the margins where I\u2019d counted down the minutes to lunch as if I was keeping track of the timer on a bomb.\\n\\nMadison was talking with her friends.  She was popular, but not gorgeous in the way the stereotypical popular girls on TV were.  She was \u2018adorable\u2019, instead.  Petite.  She played up the image with sky blue pins in her shoulder length brown hair and a cutesy attitude. Madison wore a strapless top and denim skirt, which seemed absolutely moronic to me given the fact that it was still early enough in the spring that we could see our breath in the mornings.\\n\\nI wasn\u2019t exactly in a position to criticize her.  Boys liked her and she had friends, while the same was hardly true for me.  The only feminine feature I had going for me was my dark curly hair, which I\u2019d grown long.  The clothes I wore didn\u2019t show skin, and I didn\u2019t deck myself out in bright colors like a bird showing off its plumage.\\n\\nGuys liked her, I think, because she was appealing without being intimidating.\\n\\nIf they only knew.\\n\\nThe bell rang with a lilting ding-dong, and I was the first one out the door.  I didn\u2019t run, but I moved at a decent clip as I headed up the stairwell to the third floor and made my way to the girl\u2019s washroom.\\n\\nThere were a half dozen girls there already, which meant I had to wait for a stall to open up.  I nervously watched the door of the bathroom, feeling my heart drop every time someone entered the room.\\n\\nAs soon as there was a free stall, I let myself in and locked the door.   I leaned against the wall and exhaled slowly.  It wasn\u2019t quite a sigh of relief.  Relief implied you felt better.  I wouldn\u2019t feel better until I got home.  No, I just felt less uneasy.\\n\\nIt took maybe five minutes before the noise of others in the washroom stopped.  A peek below the partitions showed that there was nobody else in the other stalls.  I sat on the lid of the toilet and got my brown bag lunch to begin eating.\\n\\nLunch on the toilet was routine now.  Every school day, I would finish off my brown bag lunch, then I\u2019d do homework or read a book until lunch hour was over.  The only book in my bag that I hadn\u2019t already read was called \u2018Triumvirate\u2019, a biography of the leading three members of the Protectorate.  I was thinking I would spend as long as I could on Mr. Gladly\u2019s assignment before reading, because I wasn\u2019t enjoying the book.  Biographies weren\u2019t my thing, and they were especially not my thing when I was suspicious it was all made up.\\n\\nWhatever my plan, I didn\u2019t even have a chance to finish my pita wrap.  The door of the bathroom banged open.  I froze.  I didn\u2019t want to rustle the bag and clue anyone into what I was doing, so I kept still and listened.\\n\\nI couldn\u2019t make out the voices.  The noise of the conversation was obscured by giggling and the sound of water from the sinks.  There was a knock on the door, making me jump.  I ignored it, but the person on the other side just repeated the knock.\\n\\n\u201cOccupied,\u201d I called out, hesitantly.\\n\\n\u201cOh my god, it\u2019s Taylor!\u201d one of the girls on the outside exclaimed with glee, then in response to something another girl whispered, I barely heard her add, \u201cYeah, do it!\u201d\\n\\nI stood up abruptly, letting the brown bag with the last mouthful of my lunch fall to the tiled floor.  Rushing for the door, I popped the lock open and pushed.  The door didn\u2019t budge.\\n\\nThere were noises from the stalls on either side of me, then a sound above me.  I looked up to see what it was, only to get splashed in the face.  My eyes started burning, and I was momentarily blinded by the stinging fluid in my eyes and my blurring of my glasses.  I could taste it as it ran down to my nose and mouth.  Cranberry juice.\\n\\nThey didn\u2019t stop there.  I managed to pull my glasses off just in time to see Madison and Sophia leaning over the top of the stall, each of them with plastic bottles at the ready.  I bent over with my hands shielding my head just before they emptied the contents over me.\\n\\nIt ran down the back of my neck, soaked my clothes, fizzed as it ran through my hair.  I pushed against the door again, but the girl on the other side was braced against it with her body.\\n\\nIf the girls pouring juice and soda on me were Madison and Sophia, that meant the girl on the other side of the door was Emma, leader of the trio.  Feeling a flare of anger at the realization, I shoved on the door, the full weight of my body slamming against it.  I didn\u2019t accomplish anything, and my shoes lost traction on the juice-slick floor.  I fell to my knees in the puddling juice.\\n\\nEmpty plastic bottles with labels for grape and cranberry juice fell to the ground around me.  A bottle of orange soda bounced off my shoulder to splash into the puddle before rolling under the partition and into the next stall.  The smell of the fruity drinks and sodas was sickly sweet. !@middle@!\\n\\nThe door swung open, and I glared up at the three girls.  Madison, Sophia and Emma.  Where Madison was cute, a late bloomer, Sophia and Emma were the types of girls that fit the \u2018prom queen\u2019 image.  Sophia was dark skinned, with a slender, athletic build she\u2019d developed as a runner on the school track team.  Red-headed Emma, by contrast, had all the curves the guys wanted.  She was good looking enough to get occasional jobs as a amateur model for the catalogs that the local department stores and malls put out.  The three of them were laughing like it was the funniest thing in the world, but the sounds of their amusement barely registered with me.  My attention was on the faint roar of blood pumping in my ears and an urgent, ominous crackling \u2018sound\u2019 that wouldn\u2019t get any quieter or less persistent if I covered my ears with my hands.  I could feel dribbles running down my arms and back, still chilled from the refrigerated vending machines.\\n\\nI didn\u2019t trust myself to say something that wouldn\u2019t give them fodder to taunt me with, so I kept silent.\\n\\nCarefully, I climbed to my feet and turned my back on them to get my backpack off the top of the toilet.  Seeing it gave me pause.  It had been a khaki green, before, but now dark purple blotches covered it, most of the contents of a bottle of grape juice.  Pulling the straps around my shoulders, I turned around.  The girls weren\u2019t there.  I heard the bathroom door bang shut, cutting off the sounds of their glee, leaving me alone in the bathroom, drenched.\\n\\nI approached the sink and stared at myself in the scratched, stained mirror that was bolted above it.  I had inherited a thin lipped, wide, expressive mouth from my mother, but my large eyes and my gawky figure made me look a lot more like my dad.  My dark hair was soaked enough that it clung to my scalp, neck and shoulders.  I was wearing a brown hooded sweatshirt over a green t-shirt, but colored blotches of purple, red and orange streaked both.  My glasses were beaded with the multicolored droplets of juice and soda.  A drip ran down my nose and fell from the tip to land in the sink.\\n\\nUsing a paper towel from the dispenser, I wiped my glasses off and put them on again.  The residual streaks made it just as hard to see, if not worse than it had been.\\n\\nDeep breaths, Taylor, I told myself.\\n\\nI pulled the glasses off to clean them again with a wet towel, and found the streaks were still there.\\n\\nAn inarticulate scream of fury and frustration escaped my lips, and I kicked the plastic bucket that sat just beneath the sink, sending it and the toilet brush inside flying into the wall.  When that wasn\u2019t enough, I pulled off my backpack and used a two-handed grip to hurl it.  I wasn\u2019t using my locker anymore: certain individuals had vandalized or broken into it on four different occasions.  My bag was heavy, loaded down with everything I\u2019d anticipated needing for the day\u2019s classes.  It crunched audibly on impact with the wall.\\n\\n\u201cWhat the fuck!?\u201d I screamed to nobody in particular, my voice echoing in the bathroom.  There were tears in the corners of my eyes.\\n\\n\u201cThe hell am I supposed to do!?\u201d  I wanted to hit something, break something.  To retaliate against the unfairness of the world.  I almost struck the mirror, but I held back.  It was such a small thing that it felt like it would make me feel more insignificant instead of venting my frustration.\\n\\nI\u2019d been enduring this from the very first day of high school, a year and a half ago.  The bathroom had been the closest thing I could find to refuge.  It had been lonely and undignified, but it had been a place I could retreat to, a place where I was off their radar.  Now I didn\u2019t even have that.\\n\\nI didn\u2019t even know what I was supposed to do for my afternoon classes.  Our midterm project for art was due, and I couldn\u2019t go to class like this.  Sophia would be there, and I could just imagine her smug smile of satisfaction as I showed up looking like I\u2019d botched an attempt to tie-dye everything I owned.\\n\\nBesides, I\u2019d just thrown my bag against the wall and I doubted my project was still in one piece.\\n\\nThe buzzing at the edge of my consciousness was getting worse.  My hands shook as I bent over and gripped the edge of the sink, let out a long, slow breath, and let my defenses drop.  For three months, I\u2019d held back.  Right now?  I didn\u2019t care anymore.\\n\\nI shut my eyes and felt the buzzing crystallize into concrete information.  As numerous as stars in the night sky, tiny knots of intricate data filled the area around me.  I could focus on each one in turn, pick out details.  The clusters of data had been reflexively drifting towards me since I was first splashed in the face.  They responded to my subconscious thoughts and emotions, as much of a reflection of my frustration, my anger, my hatred for those three girls as my pounding heart and trembling hands were.  I could make them stop or direct them to move almost without thinking about it, the same way I could raise an arm or twitch a finger.\\n\\nI opened my eyes.  I could feel adrenaline thrumming through my body, blood coursing in my veins.  I shivered in response to the chilled soft drinks and juices the trio had poured over me, with anticipation and with just a little fear.  On every surface of the bathroom were bugs; Flies, ants, spiders, centipedes, millipedes, earwigs, beetles, wasps and bees.  With every passing second, more streamed in through the open window and the various openings in the bathroom, moving with surprising speed.  Some crawled in through a gap where the sink drain entered the wall while others emerged from the triangular hole in the ceiling where a section of foam tile had broken off, or from the opened window with peeling paint and cigarette butts squished out in the recesses.  They gathered around me and spread out over every available surface; primitive bundles of signals and responses, waiting for further instruction.\\n\\nMy practice sessions, conducted away from prying eyes, told me I could direct a single insect to move an antennae, or command the gathered horde to move in formation.  With one thought, I could single out a particular group, maturity or species from this jumble and direct them as I wished.  An army of soldiers under my complete control.\\n\\nIt would be so easy, so easy to just go Carrie on the school.  To give the trio their just desserts and make them regret what they had put me through: the vicious e-mails, the trash they\u2019d upended over my desk, the flute \u2013my mother\u2019s flute\u2013 they\u2019d stolen from my locker.  It wasn\u2019t just them either.  Other girls and a small handful of boys had joined in, \u2018accidentally\u2019 skipping over me when passing out assignment handouts, adding their own voices to the taunts and the flood of nasty emails, to get the favor and attention of three of the prettier and more popular girls in our grade.\\n\\nI was all too aware that I\u2019d get caught and arrested if I attacked my fellow students.  There were three teams of superheroes and any number of solo heroes in the city.  I didn\u2019t really care.  The thought of my father seeing the aftermath on the news, his disappointment in me, his shame?  That was more daunting, but it still didn\u2019t outweigh the anger and frustration.\\n\\nExcept I was better than that.\\n\\nWith a sigh, I sent an instruction to the gathered swarm.   Disperse.  The word wasn\u2019t as important  as the idea behind it.  They began to exit the room, disappearing into the cracks in the tile and through the open window.  I walked over to the door and stood with my back to it so nobody could stumble onto the scene before the bugs were all gone.\\n\\nHowever much I wanted to, I couldn\u2019t really follow through.  Even as I trembled with humiliation, I managed to convince myself to pick up my backpack and head down the hall.  I made my way out of the school, ignoring the stares and giggles from everyone I walked past, and caught the first bus that headed in the general direction of home.  The chill of early spring compounded the discomfort of my soaked hair and clothes, making me shiver.\\n\\nI was going to be a superhero. !@bottom@! That was the goal I used to calm myself down at moments like these.  It was what I used to make myself get out of bed on a school day.  It was a crazy dream that made things tolerable.  It was something to look forward to, something to work towards.  It made it possible to keep from dwelling on the fact that Emma Barnes, leader of the trio, had once been my best friend.\\n",

This chapter considers concept learning: acquiring the definition of a general category given a sample of positive and negative training examples of the category. Concept learning can be formulated as a problem of searching through a predefined space of potential hypotheses for the hypothesis that best fits the train- ing examples. In many cases this search can be efficiently organized by taking advantage of a naturally occurring structure over the hypothesis space-a general- to-specific ordering of hypotheses. This chapter presents several learning algorithms and considers situations under which they converge to the correct hypothesis. We also examine the nature of inductive learning and the justification by which any program may successfully generalize beyond the observed training data. !@top@!\\n2.1 INTRODUCTION \\nMuch of learning involves acquiring general concepts from specific training exam- ples. People, for example, continually learn general concepts or categories such as \"bird,\" \"car,\" \"situations in which I should study more in order to pass the exam,\" etc. Each such concept can be viewed as describing some subset of ob- jects or events defined over a larger set (e.g., the subset of animals that constitute birds). Alternatively, each concept can be thought of as a boolean-valued function defined over this larger set (e.g., a function defined over all animals, whose value is true for birds and false for other animals). In this chapter we consider the problem of automatically inferring the general definition of some concept, given examples labeled as+.members or nonmembers of the concept. This task is commonly referred to as concept learning, or approx- imating a boolean-valued function from examples. Concept learning. Inferring a boolean-valued function from training examples of its input and output. \\n2.2 A CONCEPT LEARNING TASK \\nTo ground our discussion of concept learning, consider the example task of learn- ing the target concept \"days on which my friend Aldo enjoys his favorite water sport.\" Table 2.1 describes a set of example days, each represented by a set of attributes. The attribute EnjoySport indicates whether or not Aldo enjoys his favorite water sport on this day. The task is to learn to predict the value of EnjoySport for an arbitrary day, based on the values of its other attributes. What hypothesis representation shall we provide to the learner in this case? Let us begin by considering a simple representation in which each hypothesis consists of a conjunction of constraints on the instance attributes. In particular, let each hypothesis be a vector of six constraints, specifying the values of the six attributes Sky, AirTemp, Humidity, Wind, Water, and Forecast. For each attribute, the hypothesis will either 0 indicate by a \"?\\' that any value is acceptable for this attribute, 0 specify a single required value (e.g., Warm) for the attribute, or 0 indicate by a \"0\" that no value is acceptable. If some instance x satisfies all the constraints of hypothesis h, then h clas- sifies x as a positive example (h(x) = 1). To illustrate, the hypothesis that Aldo enjoys his favorite sport only on cold days with high humidity (independent of the values of the other attributes) is represented by the expression (?, Cold, High, ?, ?, ?)\\nThe most general hypothesis-that sented by every day is a positive example-is (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?) and the most specific possible hypothesis-that represented by repre- no day is a positive example-is (0,0,0,0,0,0) To summarize, the EnjoySport concept learning task requires learning the set of days for which EnjoySport = yes, describing this set by a conjunction of constraints over the instance attributes. In general, any concept learning task can be described by the set of instances over which the target function is defined, the target function, the set of candidate hypotheses considered by the learner, and the set of available training examples. The definition of the EnjoySport concept learning task in this general form is given in Table 2.2. \\n2.2.1 Notation Throughout \\nthis book, we employ the following terminology when discussing concept learning problems. The set of items over which the concept is defined is called the set of instances, which we denote by X. In the current example, X is the set of all possible days, each represented by the attributes Sky, AirTemp, Humidity, Wind, Water, and Forecast. The concept or function to be learned is called the target concept, which we denote by c. In general, c can be any boolean- valued function defined over the instances X; that is, c : X + {O, 1). In the current example, the target concept corresponds to the value of the attribute EnjoySport (i.e., c(x) = 1 if EnjoySport = Yes, and c(x) = 0 if EnjoySport = No).\\n\\nGiven: \\n0 Instances X: Possible days, each described by the attributes \\n0 Sky (with possible values Sunny, Cloudy, and Rainy), \\n0 AirTemp (with values Warm and Cold), \\n0 Humidity (with values Normal and High), 0 Wind (with values Strong and Weak), \\n0 Water (with values Warm and Cool), and 0 Forecast (with values Same and Change). \\n0 Hypotheses H: Each hypothesis is described by a conjunction of constraints on the at- tributes Sky, AirTemp, Humidity, Wind, Water, and Forecast. The constraints may be \"?\" (any value is acceptable), \"0 (no value is acceptable), or a specific value. \\n0 Target concept c: EnjoySport : X + (0,l)\\n0 Training examples D: Positive and negative examples of the target function (see Table 2.1). \\n0 Determine: \\n0 A hypothesis h in H such that h(x) = c(x) for all x in X.\\n\\nWhen learning the target concept, the learner is presented a set of training examples, each consisting of an instance x from X, along with its target concept value c(x) (e.g., the training examples in Table 2.1). Instances for which c(x) = 1 are called positive examples, or members of the target concept. Instances for which C(X) = 0 are called negative examples, or nonmembers of the target concept. We will often write the ordered pair (x, c(x)) to describe the training example consisting of the instance x and its target concept value c(x). We use the symbol D to denote the set of available training examples. Given a set of training examples of the target concept c, the problem faced by the learner is to hypothesize, or estimate, c. We use the symbol H to denote the set of all possible hypotheses that the learner may consider regarding the identity of the target concept. Usually H is determined by the human designer\\'s choice of hypothesis representation. In general, each hypothesis h in H represents a boolean-valued function defined over X; that is, h : X --+ {O, 1). The goal of the learner is to find a hypothesis h such that h(x) = c(x) for a\" x in X.\\n2.2.2 The Inductive Learning Hypothesis \\nNotice that although the learning task is to determine a hypothesis h identical to the target concept c over the entire set of instances X, the only information available about c is its value over the training examples. Therefore, inductive learning algorithms can at best guarantee that the output hypothesis fits the target concept over the training data. Lacking any further information, our assumption is that the best hypothesis regarding unseen instances is the hypothesis that best fits the observed training data. This is the fundamental assumption of inductive learning, and we will have much more to say about it throughout this book. We state it here informally and will revisit and analyze this assumption more formally and more quantitatively in Chapters 5, 6, and 7. The inductive learning hypothesis. Any hypothesis found to approximate the target function well over a sufficiently large set of training examples will also approximate the target function well over other unobserved examples. !@middle@!\\n2.3 CONCEPT LEARNING AS SEARCH \\nConcept learning can be viewed as the task of searching through a large space of hypotheses implicitly defined by the hypothesis representation. The goal of this search is to find the hypothesis that best fits the training examples. It is important to note that by selecting a hypothesis representation, the designer of the learning algorithm implicitly defines the space of all hypotheses that the program can ever represent and therefore can ever learn. Consider, for example, the instances X and hypotheses H in the EnjoySport learning task. Given that the attribute Sky has three possible values, and that AirTemp, Humidity, Wind, Water, and Forecast each have two possible values, the instance space X contains exactly 3 .2 2 .2 2 .2 = 96 distinct instances. A similar calculation shows that there are 5.4-4 -4 -4.4 = 5 120 syntactically distinct hypotheses within H. Notice, however, that every hypothesis containing one or more \"IZI\" symbols represents the empty set of instances; that is, it classifies every instance as negative. Therefore, the number of semantically distinct hypotheses is only 1 + (4.3.3.3.3.3) = 973. Our EnjoySport example is a very simple learning task, with a relatively small, finite hypothesis space. Most practical learning tasks involve much larger, sometimes infinite, hypothesis spaces. If we view learning as a search problem, then it is natural that our study of learning algorithms will exa~the different strategies for searching the hypoth- esis space. We will be particula ly interested in algorithms capable of efficiently searching very large or infinite hypothesis spaces, to find the hypotheses that best fit the training data. 2.3.1 General-to-Specific Ordering of Hypotheses Many algorithms for concept learning organize the search through the hypothesis space by relying on a very useful structure that exists for any concept learning problem: a general-to-specific ordering of hypotheses. By taking advantage of this naturally occurring structure over the hypothesis space, we can design learning algorithms that exhaustively search even infinite hypothesis spaces without explic- itly enumerating every hypothesis. To illustrate the general-to-specific ordering, consider the two hypotheses hi = (Sunny, ?, ?, Strong, ?, ?) h2 = (Sunny, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?) Now consider the sets of instances that are classified positive by hl and by h2. Because h2 imposes fewer constraints on the instance, it classifies more instances as positive. In fact, any instance classified positive by hl will also be classified positive by h2. Therefore, we say that h2 is more general than hl. This intuitive \"more general than\" relationship between hypotheses can be defined more precisely as follows. First, for any instance x in X and hypothesis h in H, we say that x satisjies h if and only if h(x) = 1. We now define the relation in terms of the sets of instances that sat- isfy the two hypotheses: Given hypotheses hj and hk, hj is more-general-thanm-- equaldo hk if and only if any instance that satisfies hk also satisfies hi. more-general~han_or.-equal~o \\nWe will also find it useful to consider cases where one hypothesis is strictly more general than the other. Therefore, we will say that hj is (strictly) more-generaldhan hk (written hj >, hk) if and only if (hj p, hk) A (hk 2, hi). Finally, we will sometimes find the inverse useful and will say that hj is morespecijkthan hk when hk is more_general-than hj. To illustrate these definitions, consider the three hypotheses hl, h2, and h3 from our Enjoysport example, shown in Figure 2.1. How are these three hypotheses related by the p, relation? As noted earlier, hypothesis h2 is more general than hl because every instance that satisfies hl also satisfies h2. Simi- larly, h2 is more general than h3. Note that neither hl nor h3 is more general than the other; although the instances satisfied by these two hypotheses intersect, neither set subsumes the other. Notice also that the p, and >, relations are de- fined independent of the target concept. They depend only on which instances satisfy the two hypotheses and not on the classification of those instances accord- ing to the target concept. Formally, the p, relation defines a partial order over the hypothesis space H (the relation is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive). Informally, when we say the structure is a partial (as opposed to total) order, we mean there may be pairs of hypotheses such as hl and h3, such that hl 2, h3 and h3 2, hl. The pg relation is important because it provides a useful structure over the hypothesis space H for any concept learning problem. The following sections present concept learning algorithms that take advantage of this partial order to efficiently organize the search for hypotheses that fit the training data\\n2.4 FIND-S: FINDING A MAXIMALLY SPECIFIC HYPOTHESIS \\nHow can we use the more-general-than partial ordering to organize the search for a hypothesis consistent with the observed training examples? One way is to begin with the most specific possible hypothesis in H, then generalize this hypothesis each time it fails to cover an observed positive training example. (We say that a hypothesis \"covers\" a positive example if it correctly classifies the example as positive.) To be more precise about how the partial ordering is used, consider the FIND-S algorithm defined in Table 2.3. To illustrate this algorithm, assume the learner is given the sequence of training examples from Table 2.1 for the EnjoySport task. The first step of FIND- S is to initialize h to the most specific hypothesis in H Upon observing the first training example from Table 2.1, which happens to be a positive example, it becomes clear that our hypothesis is too specific. In particular, none of the \"0\" constraints in h are satisfied by this example, so each is replaced by the next more general constraint {hat fits the example; namely, the attribute values for this training example. h -+ (Sunny, Warm, Normal, Strong, Warm, Same) This h is still very specific; it asserts that all instances are negative except for the single positive training example we have observed. Next, the second training example (also positive in this case) forces the algorithm to further generalize h, this time substituting a \"?\\' in place of any attribute value in h that is not satisfied by the new example. The refined hypothesis in this case is h -+ (Sunny, Warm, ?, Strong, Warm, Same) Upon encountering the third training example-in this case a negative exam- ple-the algorithm makes no change to h. In fact, the FIND-S algorithm simply ignores every negative example! While this may at first seem strange, notice that in the current case our hypothesis h is already consistent with the new negative ex- ample (i-e., h correctly classifies this example as negative), and hence no revision is needed. In the general case, as long as we assume that the hypothesis space H contains a hypothesis that describes the true target concept c and that the training data contains no errors, then the current hypothesis h can never require a revision in response to a negative example. To see why, recall that the current hypothesis h is the most specific hypothesis in H consistent with the observed positive exam- ples. Because the target concept c is also assumed to be in H and to be consistent with the positive training examples, c must be more.general_than-or-equaldo h. But the target concept c will never cover a negative example, thus neither will h (by the definition of more-general~han). Therefore, no revision to h will be required in response to any negative example. To complete our trace of FIND-S, the fourth (positive) example leads to a further generalization of h h t (Sunny, Warm, ?, Strong, ?, ?) The FIND-S algorithm illustrates one way in which the more-generaldhan partial ordering can be used to organize the search for an acceptable hypothe- sis. The search moves from hypothesis to hypothesis, searching from the most specific to progressively more general hypotheses along one chain of the partial ordering. Figure 2.2 illustrates this search in terms of the instance and hypoth- esis spaces. At each step, the hypothesis is generalized only as far as neces- sary to cover the new positive example. Therefore, at each stage the hypothesis is the most specific hypothesis consistent with the training examples observed up to this point (hence the name FIND-S). The literature on concept learning populated by many different algorithms that utilize this same more-general-than partial ordering to organize the search in one fashion or another. A number of such algorithms are discussed in this chapter, and several others are presented in Chapter 10.\\nThe !@bottom@! key property of the FIND-S algorithm is that for hypothesis spaces de- scribed by conjunctions of attribute constraints (such as H for the EnjoySport task), FIND-S is guaranteed to output the most specific hypothesis within H that is consistent with the positive training examples. Its final hypothesis will also be consistent with the negative examples provided the correct target con- cept is contained in H, and provided the training examples are correct. How- ever, there are several questions still left unanswered by this learning algorithm.\\n'",

SMARTCOOKIE overcomes these challenges and presents a practical defense for large network operators, who control backbone switches and servers in their network. This setting opens unique opportunities for a division of labor that SMARTCOOKIE intelligently exploits (Figure 1c). \\n### 3.1 Threat Model \\nThere are four key players in our threat model: clients, adver- saries, switches, and servers. Switches and servers are con- trolled by the same !@top@! network operator, which seeks to protect its servers from resource strain, while concurrently protecting network bandwidth. Under the same administrative authority, switches and servers can safely cooperate. \\nClients. Client communications to any of the servers hosted by the provider backbone should be protected from SYN flooding disruption. Clients should also not experience de- graded performance as a result of any deployed defense. \\nAdversaries. Our threat model focuses on asymmetric SYN-flooding attacks, where adversaries require orders of magnitude fewer resources than defenses. Asymmetric at- tacks are generally regarded as more challenging to defend against [17, 26], and their lower cost is likely what makes them so prevalent in the wild [50]. In our threat model, ad- versaries can spoof source IP addresses or utilize a limited number of compromised devices to send a flood of connection handshake requests that appear to be from unique clients and must be individually handled [7]. When spoofing, adversaries cannot gain feedback from the defense, as response packets to spoofed addresses never reach the adversary. Adversaries can also send some probe packets without spoofing to observe the resulting cookies and attempt to crack the cookie hash, as well as launch replay attacks using earlier cookies (\u00a72.4). We assume the adversary can send attack traffic at up to Tbps rates. The adversary does not have physical access to the net- work switches or servers hosted by the provider backbone, and traffic from the adversary cannot reach the server without traversing a participating switch. In other words, the adver- sary cannot tamper with packets between the switches and servers internal to the provider backbone. \\nSwitches. The switches are programmable, high-speed net- work hardware capable of Tbps processing rates. They are controlled by the same network provider and deployed at the network edge. Since the switches and servers are under the same centralized operator, we assume the communication channel between the switches and the servers is secure. \\nServers. Physical servers, hereafter simply called servers, are owned, operated, and trusted by the network provider, and thus can be modified. Trusted defense modules run on the servers, but for immediate deployability, changes to the TCP\/IP stack of the server\u2019s Linux kernel are not required. However, modest changes to the server TCP\/IP stack can open further defense opportunities in the future (see \u00a7D). We note that tenant VMs running on the physical servers are not trusted and thus are unmodified by the network provider. Also, in order to not affect the performance of applications running on the server, it is critical that any defense mechanism does not consume excessive CPU cycles. \\n### 3.2 Challenges \\nModern programmable switches support flexible packet pro- cessing optimized for Tbps speeds [14,42,45]. They exert fine- grained control over packet forwarding in the data plane with line-rate throughput guarantees, but do so at the cost of strict constraints enforced by the underlying hardware [12, 13, 42]. Thus, there are fundamental challenges to overcome to realize the potential of a high-speed switch defense. \\nChallenge 1: Limited In-Switch Programming Model for Cryptographic Operations. Most programmable switches do not natively support any cryptographic primitives, and they can only process packets with a limited number of available operations (e.g., addition, subtraction, and XOR, but no multiplication or division). However, even more fundamen- tally, to guarantee high-throughput, switches use a pipeline model with only a limited number of stages for packet pro- cessing. Operations can also only be performed concurrently in a stage if there are no dependencies between operations. Finally, the output of one computation cannot be used until the following pipeline stage, making it difficult to fit all the necessary operations for cryptographic SYN cookie computa- tion within the limited number of available stages. Thus, even if cryptographic accelerators were introduced on hardware switches, computing secure cookies within the computational constraints and limited stages is challenging, and could break the performance of the switch if done naively. We show how SMARTCOOKIE overcomes these challenges in \u00a75. \\nChallenge 2: Limited In-Switch Memory for Per- Connection State. The amount of available data plane mem- ory is limited, and it must be shared with other applications (e.g., routing tables) running on the switch. To perform se- quence number translations and maintain the correctness of packet-processing, a naive defense would need to keep cum- bersome per-flow state on the order of 6 bytes per connection (e.g., the 32-bit sequence number and hashed connection 5- tuple key). Unlike other data plane applications that require keeping significantly less state (e.g., a small 6-bit version number along with a hashed 5-tuple key) [52], the amount of state that must be kept by a defense cannot be further com- pressed with a hash digest, as this would cause information loss and break connections. Given available memory is on the order of tens of MBs, keeping this amount of state for every verified flow in a large network provider cannot scale to even hundreds of thousands of connections [51], and thus we sim- ply cannot afford to allocate switch memory for each ongoing TCP flow. We show in \u00a76 how SMARTCOOKIE intelligently partitions the defense to gracefully handle this challenge. \\n## 4 SMARTCOOKIE Architecture \\nTo overcome the challenges and existing limitations, SMART- COOKIE proposes a novel split-proxy architecture (Figure 2). \\nSwitch Agent. The SMARTCOOKIE switch agent performs cookie checks securely (F1) and tracks verified connections approximately (F3.A). This design is motivated by the under- lying switch architecture, which is optimized for high-speed packet processing up to Tbps, an order of magnitude greater than the speeds of general-purpose CPUs. The switch agent is an ideal location for offloading of SYN cookie checks. It can securely and performantly block 100% of SYN floods, without burdening the server (\u00a75,\u00a78). Recall that to achieve high throughput and low latency, however, the switch only has a limited amount of memory, and memory accesses are con- strained. Thus, the switch agent should not be required to re- member all the connections that have successfully passed the cookie check. In other words, verified records should be kept in an approximate data structure at the switch agent (\u00a76.3). \\nServer Agent. Meanwhile, SMARTCOOKIE server agent is primarily responsible for handling benign connections, con- ducting sequence number translations (F2) and exactly track- ing verified connections (F3.B). Servers offer greater com- pute flexibility and have fewer constraints on memory access and usage than switches. Thus, the server agent is ideal for maintaining exact information about verified connections and for performing sequence number translations on behalf of the switch agent. This offloading of unique per-connection sequence number translations is enabled by a special setup procedure, which the switch agent and server agent coopera- tively perform using custom setup request and confirmation packets (\u00a76). The server agent\u2019s sequence number translation mechanism ensures consistent sequence number progression, preserves the correctness of the TCP protocol, and is transpar- ent to unmodified end hosts. We note that the greater compute flexibility at the server agent comes at the cost of lower packet- processing speeds as compared to hardware speeds, but this is a reasonable tradeoff since the amount of benign traffic the server agent must process is much smaller than the amount of attack traffic that the switch agent must identify and drop. \\n## 5 Secure SYN Cookies in the Data Plane \\nSMARTCOOKIE switch agent is responsible for performantly computing and verifying SYN cookies in the data plane, but for any defense to be worthwhile, this must be done securely. \\nChoice of Hash Function. There are several potential choices of data-plane hash functions. Recall that because of the computational constraints of the switch, it is extremely challenging to compute a cryptographically secure hash func- tion in the data plane. Hence, several prior works [51, 72] opted to use the CRC32 checksum as a \u201chash\u201d function to compute SYN cookies, resulting in significant vulnerabil- ity [70]. This is because an adaptive adversary can always send crafted SYN packets and observe the resulting cookies (i.e., a chosen-plaintext attack), efficiently solve and extract the key used in hashing, and then forge cookies for any 4-tuple, bypassing the defense entirely (\u00a72.4). \\nSMARTCOOKIE securely computes and verifies cookies using HalfSipHash-2-4 [8], which is from the SipHash family of hashes used by Linux for computing SYN cookies [2]. We also choose HalfSipHash-2-4 for performance reasons, as it is faster than SipHash-2-4, while still sharing the same construc- tion. We believe HalfSipHash-2-4 with key rotation offers acceptable security against even well-provisioned adversaries (e.g., key brute-forcing adversaries), achieving good security along with lightweight performance. The hash is cryptograph- ically robust and designed for speed on short inputs, making it ideal for computing cookies in the data plane, where the input to the hash is just a few bytes from the packet header. \\nSecurely Computing Cookies. HalfSipHash is seeded by secret keys, used to initialize four internal variables v0-v3 (Fig- ure 3). The hash input gets mixed with these internal variables using arithmetic operations (Add, Shift, XOR) across several computational rounds. HalfSipHash-c-d performs c rounds of computation (compression rounds) for each w 32-bit word of the hash input. Once all input bytes have been processed by compression rounds, an additional d rounds of computation are performed, !@middle@! called finalization rounds. Finally, the four internal variables are XORed, giving the hash output. \\nEach round of computation requires 14 arithmetic oper- ations, including six circular left shifts. Since most of the arithmetic operations directly use the output of the previous operation (Figure 3), they create a long dependency chain. Since the P4 language [36] does not natively support the cir- cular shift operation, naively implementing a circular left shift of n bits requires three intermediate operations: a left shift of n bits, a right shift of 32 - n bits, and then a bitwise OR of these two intermediate results. Because of the dependency chain between the bitwise OR and the intermediate shifts, calculating a single circular shift will require two pipeline stages, which quickly becomes unreasonably costly given the limited number of available stages in the switch. \\nInstead of using a multi-operation, multi-stage approach to circular bit shifts, we optimize the computation by using a built-in slicing primitive on the switch to slice out the desired upper and lower bits of the variable. We then use a supported concatenation primitive to stitch the newly relocated bits to- gether in a new variable, fitting the full circular shift into one operation in a single pipeline stage. Additionally, we optimize the number of pipeline stages needed for the computation, by manually grouping the 14 arithmetic operations in a round into 4 stages based on their dependencies. \\nRecirculation. To calculate cookies, we need to operate HalfSipHash on a 16-byte (w = 4 word) input, requiring in total 2w + 4 = 12 compression and finalization rounds. Al- though we have optimized HalfSipHash for modern switch hardware, we still require several pipeline passes to perform all the rounds. Hardware switches support a packet recircu- lation feature that allows for computation across multiple pipeline passes. We note that naively using just the ingress pipeline of the switch for computing the hash would require r = (2w+4)\/2\u22121 = w+1 = 5 recirculations. However, we integrate HalfSipHash with SMARTCOOKIE\u2019s switch agent logic to run in both the ingress and egress pipelines, reducing r to (2w + 4)\/4 \u2212 1 = w\/2 = 2 recirculations per hash. \\nIn practice, network switches have dedicated recirculation ports, and additional ports can be reserved for recirculation. Dedicating additional ports for recirculation would reduce the bandwidth that could have been used for serving other traffic, but this is an acceptable performance tradeoff for the security gains of a robust hash. We show in \u00a78 that even with recirculations, our HalfSipHash-based switch agent returns secure cookies 2.6x faster than the next fastest defense. Addi- tionally, the recirculation limitations of our prototype result from the lack of cryptographic building blocks in the network hardware, which can be improved in the future. \\nKey Rotation. To defend against brute-force attacks, Half- SipHash keys are rotated periodically (e.g., every 5-30 sec- onds). This reflects our underestimation of the time needed to brute-force a key [8]. To ensure handshakes from clients are not accidentally blocked, cookies computed with an old key are still accepted for a short period after a key rotation. \\n## 6 Split-Proxy Design \\nWith our secure SYN cookie hash in the data plane, we can now safely offload cookie checks to a high-speed switch. How- ever, we must still tackle the challenge of limited switch mem- ory for handling benign flows. SMARTCOOKIE accomplishes this with a split-proxy design, where a switch agent and server agent cooperate to performantly stop attack traffic and cor- rectly handle benign traffic. Our design avoids packet buffer- ing during setup and bypasses sequence number translations at the switch agent, allowing it to approximately track verified connections and scale beyond available switch memory. \\n### 6.1 Switch to Server Two-Way Handshake \\nFigure 4 shows SMARTCOOKIE\u2019s complete setup procedure for verified connections. In packets 1-3 SMARTCOOKIE switch agent verifies clients by performing a secure SYN cookie check as in the traditional defense. However, under the SMARTCOOKIE protocol, the switch agent does not buffer the final ACK of the TCP three-way handshake (3WHS) between the client and switch agent. Instead, the switch agent directly forwards this ACK packet to the SMARTCOOKIE server agent with an additional setup tag, notifying the server agent to bootstrap the connection setup (packet 4). The switch agent also uses this packet to instruct the server agent how to handle the difference in initial sequence numbers (ISNs) that were chosen by the switch agent and the server\u2019s network stack. \\nAfter receiving this tagged setup packet, the server agent sets up its side of the connection, shown with packets 5-7a. The server agent then sends a packet to the switch agent to confirm the connection establishment, completing the custom setup between switch agent and server agent as shown with packet 7b. Note that the server agent has been instructed by the switch agent how to handle sequence number deltas, so the client and server see their expected sequence numbers in both directions. This allows the switch agent to step into a passive forwarding role and avoid the expense of sequence number translations throughout the remainder of the connection. \\nSMARTCOOKIE converts the original 3WHS between switch and server into a custom two-way handshake (2WHS) between switch agent and server agent, notifying the server of \\nthe client connection, because at this point the server is still unaware of the client. We note that a 3WHS between switch agent and server agent is undesirable, causing overhead at the switch for buffering packets from the client while the sec- ond 3WHS is being conducted. Additionally, even after the end-to-end connection is established, per-packet processing at the switch for sequence number translations is undesir- able. Instead, by explicitly informing the server agent of the connection and sending information for sequence number translations, the switch agent can safely forward packets from a verified connection without additional processing. \\nHandling Setup Latency and Packet Drops. SMART- COOKIE reliably handles more complex scenarios introduced by !@bottom@! connection setup latency, reordered packets, or packet drops. Consider the scenario where the 2WHS between the switch agent and server agent is not yet complete, either be- cause it is still in progress or because the setup packet sent to the server agent has been lost. If the client sends addi- tional data packets to the server during this state, the SMART- COOKIE switch agent handles this gracefully by continuing to verify and tag these packets before forwarding them to the server agent (note that the switch agent never buffers client packets). Since the client has yet to receive any packets from the server, the server-side sequence numbers have not pro- gressed and the client would still pass the cookie check at the switch agent. As long as the client\u2019s packets continue to pass the cookie check, the switch agent will tag and forward them to the server agent, and upon receipt of any tagged packet from the switch agent, the server agent will immediately set up the connection and send an explicit confirmation to the switch agent. Upon receiving this confirmation, the switch agent no longer tags any packets from the client and simply forwards packets in both directions.  \\n'",

Introduction and Motivating Work \\nPre-training methods which learn directly from raw text have revolutionized NLP over the last few years (Dai & Le, 2015; Peters et al., 2018; Howard & Ruder, 2018; Rad- ford et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2018; Raffel et al., 2019). \\nTask-agnostic objectives such as autoregressive and masked language modeling have scaled across many orders of mag- nitude in compute, model capacity, and data, steadily im- proving capabilities. !@top@! The development of \u201ctext-to-text\u201d as a standardized input-output interface (McCann et al., 2018; Radford et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2019) has enabled task- agnostic architectures to zero-shot transfer to downstream datasets removing the need for specialized output heads or dataset specific customization. Flagship systems like GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) are now competitive across many tasks with bespoke models while requiring little to no dataset specific training data. \\nThese results suggest that the aggregate supervision acces- sible to modern pre-training methods within web-scale col- lections of text surpasses that of high-quality crowd-labeled NLP datasets. However, in other fields such as computer vision it is still standard practice to pre-train models on crowd-labeled datasets such as ImageNet (Deng et al., 2009). Could scalable pre-training methods which learn directly from web text result in a similar breakthrough in computer vision? Prior work is encouraging. \\nOver 20 years ago Mori et al. (1999) explored improving content based image retrieval by training a model to pre- dict the nouns and adjectives in text documents paired with images. Quattoni et al. (2007) demonstrated it was possi- ble to learn more data efficient image representations via manifold learning in the weight space of classifiers trained to predict words in captions associated with images. Sri- vastava & Salakhutdinov (2012) explored deep represen- tation learning by training multimodal Deep Boltzmann Machines on top of low-level image and text tag features. Joulin et al. (2016) modernized this line of work and demon- strated that CNNs trained to predict words in image cap- tions learn useful image representations. They converted the title, description, and hashtag metadata of images in the YFCC100M dataset (Thomee et al., 2016) into a bag-of- words multi-label classification task and showed that pre- training AlexNet (Krizhevsky et al., 2012) to predict these labels learned representations which preformed similarly to ImageNet-based pre-training on transfer tasks. Li et al. (2017) then extended this approach to predicting phrase n- grams in addition to individual words and demonstrated the ability of their system to zero-shot transfer to other image classification datasets by scoring target classes based on their dictionary of learned visual n-grams and predicting the one with the highest score. Adopting more recent architec- tures and pre-training approaches, VirTex (Desai & Johnson, 2020), ICMLM (Bulent Sariyildiz et al., 2020), and Con- VIRT (Zhang et al., 2020) have recently demonstrated the potential of transformer-based language modeling, masked language modeling, and contrastive objectives to learn im- age representations from text. \\nWhile exciting as proofs of concept, using natural language supervision for image representation learning is still rare. This is likely because demonstrated performance on com- mon benchmarks is much lower than alternative approaches. For example, Li et al. (2017) reach only 11.5% accuracy on ImageNet in a zero-shot setting. This is well below the 88.4% accuracy of the current state of the art (Xie et al., 2020). It is even below the 50% accuracy of classic com- puter vision approaches (Deng et al., 2012). Instead, more narrowly scoped but well-targeted uses of weak supervision have improved performance. Mahajan et al. (2018) showed that predicting ImageNet-related hashtags on Instagram im- ages is an effective pre-training task. When fine-tuned to ImageNet these pre-trained models increased accuracy by over 5% and improved the overall state of the art at the time. Kolesnikov et al. (2019) and Dosovitskiy et al. (2020) have also demonstrated large gains on a broader set of transfer benchmarks by pre-training models to predict the classes of the noisily labeled JFT-300M dataset. \\nThis line of work represents the current pragmatic middle ground between learning from a limited amount of super- vised \u201cgold-labels\u201d and learning from practically unlimited amounts of raw text. However, it is not without compro- \\nmises. Both works carefully design, and in the process limit, their supervision to 1000 and 18291 classes respectively. Natural language is able to express, and therefore supervise, a much wider set of visual concepts through its general- ity. Both approaches also use static softmax classifiers to perform prediction and lack a mechanism for dynamic out- puts. This severely curtails their flexibility and limits their \\n\u201czero-shot\u201d capabilities. \\nA crucial difference between these weakly supervised mod- els and recent explorations of learning image representations directly from natural language is scale. While Mahajan et al. (2018) and Kolesnikov et al. (2019) trained their models for accelerator years on millions to billions of images, VirTex, ICMLM, and ConVIRT trained for accelerator days on one to two hundred thousand images. In this work, we close this gap and study the behaviors of image classifiers trained with natural language supervision at large scale. Enabled by the large amounts of publicly available data of this form on the internet, we create a new dataset of 400 million (im- age, text) pairs and demonstrate that a simplified version of ConVIRT trained from scratch, which we call CLIP, for Con- trastive Language-Image Pre-training, is an efficient method of learning from natural language supervision. We study the scalability of CLIP by training a series of eight models spanning almost 2 orders of magnitude of compute and ob- serve that transfer performance is a smoothly predictable function of compute (Hestness et al., 2017; Kaplan et al., 2020). We find that CLIP, similar to the GPT family, learns to perform a wide set of tasks during pre-training including OCR, geo-localization, action recognition, and many others. We measure this by benchmarking the zero-shot transfer performance of CLIP on over 30 existing datasets and find it can be competitive with prior task-specific supervised models. We also confirm these findings with linear-probe representation learning analysis and show that CLIP out- performs the best publicly available ImageNet model while also being more computationally efficient. We additionally find that zero-shot CLIP models are much more robust than equivalent accuracy supervised ImageNet models which suggests that zero-shot evaluation of task-agnostic models is much more representative of a model\u2019s capability. These re- sults have significant policy and ethical implications, which we consider in Section 7. \\n## 2. Approach \\n### 2.1. Natural Language Supervision \\nAt the core of our approach is the idea of learning percep- tion from supervision contained in natural language. As discussed in the introduction, this is not at all a new idea, however terminology used to describe work in this space is varied, even seemingly contradictory, and stated motiva- tions are diverse. Zhang et al. (2020), Gomez et al. (2017), Joulin et al. (2016), and Desai & Johnson (2020) all intro- duce methods which learn visual representations from text paired with images but describe their approaches as unsuper- vised, self-supervised, weakly supervised, and supervised respectively. \\nWe emphasize that what is common across this line of work is not any of the details of the particular methods used but the appreciation of natural language as a training signal. All these approaches are learning from natural language super- \\nvision. Although early work wrestled with the complexity of natural language when using topic model and n-gram representations, improvements in deep contextual represen- tation learning suggest we now have the tools to effectively leverage this abundant source of supervision (McCann et al., 2017). \\nLearning from natural language has several potential strengths over other training methods. It\u2019s much easier to scale natural language supervision compared to standard crowd-sourced labeling for image classification since it does not require annotations to be in a classic \u201cmachine learning compatible format\u201d such as the canonical 1-of-N majority vote \u201cgold label\u201d. Instead, methods which work on natural language can learn passively from the supervision contained in the vast amount of text on the internet. Learning from natural language also has an important advantage over most unsupervised or self-supervised learning approaches in that it doesn\u2019t \u201cjust\u201d learn a representation but also connects that representation to language which enables flexible zero-shot transfer. In the following subsections, we detail the specific approach we settled on. !@middle@!\\n### 2.2. Creating a Sufficiently Large Dataset \\nExisting work has mainly used three datasets, MS-COCO (Lin et al., 2014), Visual Genome (Krishna et al., 2017), and YFCC100M (Thomee et al., 2016). While MS-COCO and Visual Genome are high quality crowd-labeled datasets, they are small by modern standards with approximately 100,000 training photos each. By comparison, other computer vision systems are trained on up to 3.5 billion Instagram photos (Mahajan et al., 2018). YFCC100M, at 100 million photos, is a possible alternative, but the metadata for each image is sparse and of varying quality. Many images use automati- cally generated filenames like 20160716 113957.JPG as \u201ctitles\u201d or contain \u201cdescriptions\u201d of camera exposure settings. After filtering to keep only images with natural language titles and\/or descriptions in English, the dataset shrunk by a factor of 6 to only 15 million photos. This is approximately the same size as ImageNet. \\nA major motivation for natural language supervision is the large quantities of data of this form available publicly on the internet. Since existing datasets do not adequately reflect this possibility, considering results only on them would un- derestimate the potential of this line of research. To address this, we constructed a new dataset of 400 million (image, text) pairs collected form a variety of publicly available sources on the Internet. To attempt to cover as broad a set of visual concepts as possible, we search for (image, text) pairs as part of the construction process whose text includes one of a set of 500,000 queries.1 We approximately class balance the results by including up to 20,000 (image, text) pairs per query. The resulting dataset has a similar total word count as the WebText dataset used to train GPT-2. We refer to this dataset as WIT for WebImageText. \\n### 2.3. Selecting an Efficient Pre-Training Method \\nState-of-the-art computer vision systems use very large amounts of compute. Mahajan et al. (2018) required 19 GPU years to train their ResNeXt101-32x48d and Xie et al. (2020) required 33 TPUv3 core-years to train their Noisy Student EfficientNet-L2. When considering that both these systems were trained to predict only 1000 ImageNet classes, the task of learning an open set of visual concepts from natural language seems daunting. In the course of our ef- forts, we found training efficiency was key to successfully scaling natural language supervision and we selected our final pre-training method based on this metric. \\nOur initial approach, similar to VirTex, jointly trained an image CNN and text transformer from scratch to predict the caption of an image. However, we encountered difficulties efficiently scaling this method. In Figure 2 we show that a 63 million parameter transformer language model, which already uses twice the compute of its ResNet-50 image encoder, learns to recognize ImageNet classes three times slower than a much simpler baseline that predicts a bag-of- words encoding of the same text. \\nBoth these approaches share a key similarity. They try to pre- dict the exact words of the text accompanying each image. This is a difficult task due to the wide variety of descriptions, comments, and related text that co-occur with images. Re- cent work in contrastive representation learning for images has found that contrastive objectives can learn better repre- sentations than their equivalent predictive objective (Tian et al., 2019). Other work has found that although generative models of images can learn high quality image representa- tions, they require over an order of magnitude more compute than contrastive models with the same performance (Chen et al., 2020a). Noting these findings, we explored training a system to solve the potentially easier proxy task of pre- dicting only which text as a whole is paired with which image and not the exact words of that text. Starting with the same bag-of-words encoding baseline, we swapped the predictive objective for a contrastive objective in Figure 2 and observed a further 4x efficiency improvement in the rate of zero-shot transfer to ImageNet. \\nGiven a batch of N (image, text) pairs, CLIP is trained to predict which of the N \u00d7 N possible (image, text) pairings across a batch actually occurred. To do this, CLIP learns a multi-modal embedding space by jointly training an image encoder and text encoder to maximize the cosine similar- ity of the image and text embeddings of the N real pairs in the batch while minimizing the cosine similarity of the embeddings of the N2 \u2212 N incorrect pairings. We opti- mize a symmetric cross entropy loss over these similarity scores. In Figure 3 we include pseudocode of the core of an implementation of CLIP. To our knowledge this batch con- struction technique and objective was first introduced in the area of deep metric learning as the multi-class N-pair loss Sohn (2016), was popularized for contrastive representation learning by Oord et al. (2018) as the InfoNCE loss, and was recently adapted for contrastive (text, image) representation learning in the domain of medical imaging by Zhang et al. (2020). \\nDue to the large size of our pre-training dataset, over-fitting is not a major concern and the details of training CLIP are simplified compared to the implementation of Zhang et al. (2020). We train CLIP from scratch without initializing the image encoder with ImageNet weights or the text encoder with pre-trained weights. We do not use the non-linear projection between the representation and the contrastive embedding space, a change which was introduced by Bach- man et al. (2019) and popularized by Chen et al. (2020b). We instead use only a linear projection to map from each en- coder\u2019s representation to the multi-modal embedding space. We did not notice a difference in training efficiency between the two versions and speculate that non-linear projections may be co-adapted with details of current image only in self-supervised representation learning methods. We also remove the text transformation function tu from Zhang et al. (2020) which samples a single sentence at uniform from the text since many of the (image, text) pairs in CLIP\u2019s pre- training dataset are only a single sentence. We also simplify the image transformation function tv. A random square crop from resized images is the only data augmentation used during training. Finally, the temperature parameter which controls the range of the logits in the softmax, \u03c4 , is directly optimized during training as a log-parameterized multiplicative scalar to avoid turning as a hyper-parameter. \\n### 2.4. Choosing and Scaling a Model \\nWe consider two different architectures for the image en- coder. For the first, we use ResNet-50 (He et al., 2016a) as the base architecture for the image encoder due to its widespread adoption and proven performance. We make sev- eral modifications to the original version using the ResNet- D improvements from He et al. (2019) and the antialiased rect-2 blur pooling from Zhang (2019). We also replace the global average pooling layer with an attention pooling mechanism. The attention pooling is implemented as a sin- gle layer of \u201ctransformer-style\u201d multi-head QKV attention where the query is conditioned on the global average-pooled representation of the image. For the second architecture, we experiment with the recently introduced Vision Transformer (ViT) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020). We closely follow their implementation with only the minor modification of adding an additional layer normalization to the combined patch and position embeddings before the transformer and use a slightly different initialization scheme. \\nThe text encoder is a Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) with the architecture modifications described in Radford et al. (2019). As a base size we use a 63M-parameter 12- layer 512-wide model with 8 attention heads. The trans- former operates on a lower-cased byte pair encoding (BPE) representation of the text with a 49,152 vocab size (Sen- nrich et al., 2015). For computational efficiency, the max sequence length was capped at 76. The text sequence is bracketed with [SOS] and [EOS] tokens and the activa- tions of the highest layer of the transformer at the [EOS] token are treated as the feature representation of the text which is layer normalized and then linearly projected into the multi-modal embedding space. Masked self-attention was used in the text encoder to preserve the ability to ini- tialize with a pre-trained language model or add language modeling as an auxiliary objective, though exploration of this is left as future work. \\nWhile previous computer vision research has often scaled models by increasing the width (Mahajan et al., 2018) or depth (He et al., 2016a) in isolation, for the ResNet image encoders we adapt the approach of Tan & Le (2019) which found that allocating additional compute across all of width, !@bottom@! depth, and resolution outperforms only allocating it to only one dimension of the model. While Tan & Le (2019) tune the ratio of compute allocated to each dimension for their EfficientNet architecture, we use a simple baseline of allo- cating additional compute equally to increasing the width, depth, and resolution of the model. For the text encoder, we only scale the width of the model to be proportional to the calculated increase in width of the ResNet and do not scale the depth at all, as we found CLIP\u2019s performance to be less sensitive to the capacity of the text encoder. \\n'",

      "user_prompt":"# CULTURE AND THE INDIVIDUAL\\nThe difficulties of discovering \u201ctribes\u201d in the contemporary world is not a matter of searching in obscure places, but of seeing what is going on before our eyes. There is nothing unprecedented in what is happening, but there is a difference in scale. Never have cultural influences been transmitted so rapidly, and at such great distances. Consequently, it becomes increasingly difficult !@top@! to designate cultures that are bounded in any simple way. In fact, cultures in this sense always were a heuristic device, that is to say, an approximation of reality allowing us to get on with business. Nowadays anthropolo- gists are under pressure to justify every such casual claim. This has been, and remains, a serious challenge. But it has also had a stimu- lating effect on research, causing ethnographers to pursue cultures in all manner of social niches. The point is neatly made when ethnographers are tempted to refer to the \u201ctribes\u201d of Chief Executive Officers, or of scientific specialists, or even of anthropolo- gists themselves, who share an elaborate international culture, full of rituals, alliances and feuds. \\nMeanwhile, insofar as the notion of \u201ccultures\u201d has been destabi- lized, attention turns once again to how individuals react to the cultural influences tugging at them. I say \u201conce again\u201d because issues of individual and group psychology have always been important in American cultural anthropology. We approach them, however, with two premises in place. \\n## BIOLOGY, PSYCHOLOGY, CULTURE \\nFirst, there has been no retreat from the insistence on the perva- siveness of the cultural. On the contrary, it has advanced. The domain of the cultural includes everything that is neither at one extreme unique to particular individuals, like the contents of dreams, nor at the other common to the whole species, like bi- pedalism. In fact even these things can easily take on a cultural dynamic. According to neurologists, dreams are like other mental processes in that they result from electronic impulses passing through synapses in the brain. What distinguishes them is that they are not the result of sensory stimulation from the outside world, but are apparently random neural impulses. Nevertheless, they were for Freud a direct avenue into the unconscious, in which lurked sublimated desires and fears. Anyone nowadays reading Freud\u2019s analyses of dreams, however, is bound to notice echoes of the Vienna of Freud\u2019s time, with its particular social urges and anxi- eties. Consequently, we are left with several levels of reality. In order to remember a dream, let alone recount it, the dreamer must have placed meaning on random patterns of color. Next, these meanings are made, if you believe Freud, to fit things buried deep in the unconscious. Finally they have to be presented in terms of things we know in the real world, in whatever bizarre ways they are put together. That is, they are passed through a cultural lens. The comparative study of dreaming has yet to be attempted, but we know that peoples vary greatly in the attention they pay to it. Some people report elaborate dreams, even if radically different to anything a Westerner would dream. Others have a stilted reper- toire, classifying all dreams under a handful of stereotyped narratives. In either event, the universal human propensity to dream, which produces totally inward experiences unique to each individual, can only be reported in culturally appropriate terms. \\nWhat this shows is the mediation of human biology and indi- vidual psychology through cultural perception. Starting from the other end of the spectrum, walking on two legs is a characteristic of the hominid line of evolution, and no one since the Middle Ages \\nhas doubted that it is the universal mode of locomotion in all Homo sapiens populations. At the same time, however, peoples\u2019 individual gaits are subtly different. It is amazing how one can recognize friends and family without seeing their faces, even at a long distance, simply from the way they walk. But it is also the case that people move differently according to their ethnic background. Even a casual observer notices hand gestures, ways of standing while talking to others, and so on, that are part of a culturally transmitted \u201cbody language.\u201d For example, Westerners in Borneo longhouses make themselves conspicuous by walking around as if they were out in the jungle. Proper longhouse etiquette requires that someone approaching people indoors roll their shoulders inwards, and bend their knees, so as not to tower threateningly over those seated on the floor \u2013 there being no furniture. Westerners find the resulting shuffling gait embarrassingly effeminate, which is odd considering the warrior traditions of their hosts. To longhouse people, mean- while, Westerners seem ill-mannered and childishly assertive. \\n## CULTURAL IMPOVERISHMENT \\nThere is a second premise, which follows from the twentieth- century notion of culture. If you think back to the Indian seamstresses in their factory dormitories, the temptation is to see them as culturally deprived. But we have rejected any definition of culture that conceives of some people having more culture than others. These women are almost invariably multilingual, so how could they be said to \u201clack culture\u201d? Moreover, we must take into account that the young women are being exposed to all kinds of new cultural influences. Rather than industrial servitude, they may experience their jobs as liberation from pre-modern patriarchy. That is certainly what their bosses would have us believe \u2013 moder- nity on the march! \\nThere are, however, more dramatic cases. When American Indian and Australian Aborigine children were taken away from their families, it was to give them a chance to escape a poverty that was more than material. The policy is now in disrepute, but there was more than a grain of truth in the argument. For example, in rural areas of Australia where white farmers control the land, ethnogra- phers have reported very little activity among Aborigines that \\n\\nmight be connected to traditional matters: gatherings, rituals, or anything of that kind. Some Aborigines are \u201cintegrated\u201d in the sense that they work with white stockmen, and drink alongside them in the pub. But many others live lives that are in every sense marginal, housed in shacks on the outskirts of small towns, eking out an existence on government allowances, and appearing to do nothing day after day. They seem caught between cultures, unable to move either backwards or forwards. Frustrated policymakers confront anthropologists, who are supposed to know about these things, demanding to be told forthrightly what should be done. They are usually disappointed. Often, the best ethnographers can do is explain why all the proposed new interventions will do more harm than good. \\nThe point is, of course, that it is no more the ethnographer\u2019s job to tell Aborigines what they must be than it is the government\u2019s. Nor can we participate in the rhetoric of cultural impoverishment without risking all that was gained by the twentieth-century re- definition of culture. If Aborigines are culturally impoverished, what about working-class Australians reading the sports page of the newspaper rather than the international news? Clearly we are on a slippery slope here. Before long anyone without a college degree will be diagnosed as culturally impoverished, and culture will be what it was in the nineteenth century. Meanwhile, how is an ethno- grapher to describe the apparent vacuum that is \u201cthe culture\u201d of displaced Aborigines? Could we make a start with narratives of displacement, such as encounters with missionaries and landowners? Or perhaps with the Aborigine enthusiasm for \u201cwesterns,\u201d Blue Grass music, and everything to do with cowboys? Or is there in Aborigine passiveness still an echo of the hunting and gathering lifestyle? Are we missing something that our own cultural premises make invisible? If so, it will take an ethnographer of exceptional talents to show us what it is we are not seeing \u2013 most likely an Aborigine anthropologist. \\n## CULTURE AND PERSONALITY \\nLong before these terminological difficulties became acute, however, American anthropologists were dealing with similar issues of cultural worth using ideas borrowed from psychology. It was an easy step, since Freud\u2019s ideas had been received more enthusiastically in the New World than they were in the Old. In the New York of the 1920\u2019s and 1930\u2019s psychiatry was fashionable (see Box 9.1). As active participants in the intellectual ferment of the times, Boas and his students mixed socially with practicing psychiatrists, and interacted with them at conferences and seminars. Some of Boas\u2019 students underwent psychoanalysis, a process that requires a considerable investment of time and energy. It is not surprising that there would be a cross fertilization of ideas. The result is that psychology has had an impact on American anthropology second only to linguistics. \\n!@middle@! The bridge between anthropology and psychology was made through the concept of \u201cpersonality.\u201d The immediate reference of the word is, of course, to something entirely individual. If asked to describe someone\u2019s personality you might say that he or she is warm, or shy, or arrogant, or a thousand other possible attributes. You will remember, however, that the \u201cperson,\u201d in the technical jargon of Chapter Three, is not the same as the individual. In an analogous fashion, whatever is inherent in individual personalities is also molded to some extent at least by their upbringing and experience. In pursuit of this cultural aspect of personality, students of Boas elaborated the idea of a \u201cmodal personality,\u201d that is, one that is particularly admired and held up for emulation. In different societies, it was argued, different traits were valued or condemned. \\n## MODAL PERSONALITY IN DOBU \\nAn obvious place from which to take an example is Ruth Benedict\u2019s Patterns of Culture (1934). The book was written for a popular audience, and also taught to a whole generation of undergraduates in liberal arts colleges. It was such a success that it is often credited with bringing the new Boasian meaning of the word culture into general circulation. The core of Benedict\u2019s book consists of portraits of three indigenous cultures, described in terms of modal personali- ties. The Pueblo peoples of New Mexico respect a person who is gentle, self-effacing, and knowledgeable about a complex spirit world and the rituals it requires. She characterizes them as Apollonian, that is having the rational attributes of the Roman god Apollo. By contrast, the Kwakiutl of British Columbia were impetuous and boastful. She describes them as Dionysian, after the Roman god Dionysus, whose ecstatic cult involved drunkenness and sexual excesses. The Kwakiutl were fiercely competitive. In showy festivals chiefs tried to outdo each other in destruction of wealth. Shamans gained power by contact with dangerous and unpre- dictable spirits, using remains of the dead. \\nThe ethnographic material for these portraits came from the fieldwork of Boas himself, and his students who had worked among American Indians. Her third case, however, is based on the account by the New Zealand anthropologist Reo Fortune in his Sorcerers of \\nDobu (1932). Dobu is a small island off the eastern tip of New Guinea, not far from where Malinowski did his pioneering field- work. Drawing on Fortune\u2019s data, Benedict portrays a society sunk deep in paranoia. Everyone lives in constant fear of sorcery by their neighbors, and even slight misfortunes are attributed to it. Magic is needed for everything from growing crops to evading the attacks of sorcerers, and everyone jealously guards their own spells. You can imagine that marriage under these circumstances is not easy. A man seeks a bride from exactly those neighboring villages that house his enemies, and mutual distrust is so great that the couple is never allowed to set up house permanently in either village. Instead they shuttle back and forth every year, taking it in turns to be the object of contempt and suspicion in the village of their in-laws, where they are seldom well fed. Should either partner die away from home charges of murder will fly, and ordinary hostility may well escalate to violence. Even between husband and wife there is little trust or affection, at least not until the marriage has endured for several years, and everyone has settled into a grudging acceptance. Benedict repeats an anecdote about a man who declines an invita- tion to socialize with friends, on the grounds that his wife will accuse him of having had a good time. \\n## MADNESS AND DEVIANCE \\nThe success of Benedict\u2019s book shows that her portraits are convincing. In addition, her technique of giving labels to cultures makes it easy to grasp her argument and remember it. But it involves some worrying implications. When Benedict labels Dobu culture as paranoid, she is taking a diagnosis applied by psychia- trists to mentally ill patients, and applying it to a whole population. But mental illness is usually defined in terms of social functioning: the troubled individual is unable to live an ordinary life. By Benedict\u2019s own account, being paranoid is exactly the way to function in Dobu. Could a Dobuan psychiatrist then diagnose non-paranoia as a mental illness? If not, what could it possibly mean to say that a whole society is mentally ill? The proposition comes close to chau- vinism. The project of anthropology is clearly cancelled if we allow the familiar claim that the foreigners are all mad, and there is nothing more to say about them. \\nThis shows the dangers of mixing the jargons of psychology and anthropology. Benedict does not confront the issue directly, but she is careful to avoid the implication that peoples\u2019 temperaments are mechanically produced by their cultures, like nails in a nail factory. There might indeed be individuals living in a pueblo who, despite all the pressures of socialization, remain assertive and quarrelsome. In Benedict\u2019s terms they are \u201cdeviants.\u201d The same is true, however, of a Kwakiutl or Dobu person who is easygoing and likes to get on with everybody. Such misfits are likely to be miserable, and their lives difficult. This is a good moment to reflect on your own culture or cultures. What are their modal personalities? What temperament is rewarded and how? How well do you fit in, and what penalties do you suffer when you do not? \\nThere is a feature of Benedict\u2019s notion that seems odd at first glance, but turns out to be useful. When politicians speak of social deviants, they usually mean those inclined to crime or sexual irreg- ularities. But there is everywhere a movement back and forth between mere unpopularity and outright criminality. Consider, for instance, the change in attitudes in the West concerning homosexu- ality. A few decades ago active homosexuals could be thrown in jail, and so lived fearfully \u201cin the closet.\u201d They were also, according to the American Medical Association, mentally ill. Now those legal threats and diagnostic claims have largely been swept away. But, despite Gay Pride parades, homosexuality remains for many Americans deviant in Benedict\u2019s sense. Consequently her notion of deviance provided a way to think about the various ways in which people are made marginal in their own societies. \\n## PSYCHIC UNITY \\nIn Benedict\u2019s argument, every society must have its deviants because the raw material on which different cultures work is every- where the same. This doctrine is called the Psychic Unity of Humankind, and its import is sufficiently profound to merit capital letters. It can be seen as the American equivalent of the British proposition, described in Chapter Three, that all societies have insti- tutions of law, politics, economics, and so on, however diverse they may be. Each provides the basis of a relativism that runs counter to nineteenth-century evolutionism, but reflecting different national \\ntraditions. Moreover, both constitute an assertion of faith, rather than a testable hypothesis. Certainly, it would be odd for an anthro- pologist to claim that there were people anywhere in the world who did not feel love or hatred, grief or joy. To do so would surely be worse than racism. Yet it would be a ticklish problem to isolate \u201clove\u201d in every culture, and there is no reason why that particular bundle of ideas should be part of everyone\u2019s worldview. In Europe and America, a marriage is supposed to be the result of \u201cfalling\u201d in love, but that notion is far from a universal, as we saw in Chapter Six. Moreover, it would not be possible in most languages to say that you \u201clove\u201d chocolate as opposed to simply liking it, let alone \u201cloving\u201d God. Consequently, the doctrine of psychic unity is best understood simply as a broad assertion of common humanity. \\n## DANGERS OF STEREOTYPING \\nBenedict\u2019s diagnosis of Dobu culture as paranoid raises another problem, which also applies to the labels Apollonian and Dionysian. Insightful and convincing as Benedict\u2019s portraits are, her labels come dangerously close to stereotypes. Indeed in the case of Dobu she admits as much: \\nThe Dobuans are known to all the white recruiters as easy marks in the area. Risking hunger at home, they sign up readily for indentured labor; being used to coarse fare, the rations they receive as work-boys do not cause mutiny among them. The reputation of the Dobuans in the neighboring islands, however, does not turn on their poverty. They are noted rather for their dangerousness. They are said to be magi- cians who have diabolical power and warriors who halt at no treachery. A couple of generations ago, before white intervention, they were cannibals and that in an area where people eat no human flesh. They are the feared and distrusted savages of the islands surrounding them. \\n(Benedict 1934: 131) \\nIn other words, Benedict is repeating what the neighbors of the Dobuans say about them. But when we hear people describing their neighbors as cannibals, or werewolves, or inverted people, it will hardly do to take their word for it. Moreover, stereotypes are invariably phrased in negative terms. When Americans describe the British as cold, and the British describe Americans as brash, both are saying the same thing but evaluating it in reverse terms. Even if we eliminate the negativity, and say instead that the modal American personality is outgoing and friendly, while the British is polite and modest, we have gained little. Stereotypes flatten a complex reality. Some Americans are retiring, and some Britons are friendly. The interesting questions are how do friendliness and reserve vary by region, class, and context? What signals are sent out to indicate a willingness to be friendly, or the appropriateness of reserve? !@bottom@! Stereotypes may hint at something, but they routinely hide more than they reveal. \\nTo check the truth of this, consider for a moment the stereotypes that you have of others. What value are they? What do they reveal, and what do they hide? What about those that others have of you, how much do they bother you, and why? Can you make a joke about them, or take a joke, or are they too explosive for that? What historical experiences shaped those stereotypes, and how can they be revised? \\n'",

      "user_prompt":"# Johann Sebastian Bach\\nGerman composer\\n   \\nJohann Sebastian Bach (born March 21 [March 31, New Style], 1685, Eisenach, Thuringia, Ernestine Saxon Duchies [Germany]\u2014died July 28, 1750, Leipzig) composer of the Baroque era, the most celebrated member of a large family of north German musicians. Although he was admired by his contemporaries primarily as an outstanding harpsichordist, organist, and expert on organ building, Bach is now generally regarded as one of the greatest composers of all time and is celebrated as the creator of the Brandenburg Concertos, The Well-Tempered Clavier, the Mass in B Minor, and numerous other masterpieces of church and instrumental music. Appearing at a propitious moment in the history of music, Bach was able to survey and bring together the principal styles, forms, and national traditions that had developed during preceding generations and, by virtue of his synthesis, enrich them all.\\n\\nHe was a member of a remarkable family of musicians who were proud of their achievements, and about 1735 he drafted a genealogy, Ursprung der musicalisch-Bachischen Familie (\u201cOrigin of the Musical Bach Family\u201d), in which he traced his ancestry back to his great-great-grandfather Veit Bach, a Lutheran baker (or miller) who late in the 16th century was driven from Hungary to Wechmar in Thuringia, a historic region of Germany, by religious persecution and died in 1619. There were Bachs in the area before then, and it may be that, when Veit moved to Wechmar, he was returning to his birthplace. He used to take his cittern to the mill and play it while the mill was grinding. Johann Sebastian remarked, \u201cA pretty noise they must have made !@top@! together! However, he learnt to keep time, and this apparently was the beginning of music in our family.\u201d\\n\\nUntil the birth of Johann Sebastian, his was the least distinguished branch of the family; some of its members, such as Johann Christoph and Johann Ludwig, had been competent practical musicians but not composers. In later days the most important musicians in the family were Johann Sebastian\u2019s sons\u2014Wilhelm Friedemann, Carl Philipp Emanuel, and Johann Christian (the \u201cEnglish Bach\u201d).\\n\\nLife\\nEarly years\\nJ.S. Bach was the youngest child of Johann Ambrosius Bach and Elisabeth L\u00e4mmerhirt. Ambrosius was a string player, employed by the town council and the ducal court of Eisenach. Johann Sebastian started school in 1692 or 1693 and did well in spite of frequent absences. Of his musical education at this time, nothing definite is known; however, he may have picked up the rudiments of string playing from his father, and no doubt he attended the Georgenkirche, where Johann Christoph Bach was organist until 1703.\\n\\nBy 1695 both his parents were dead, and he was looked after by his eldest brother, also named Johann Christoph (1671\u20131721), organist at Ohrdruf. This Christoph had been a pupil of the influential keyboard composer Johann Pachelbel, and he apparently gave Johann Sebastian his first formal keyboard lessons. The young Bach again did well at school, and in 1700 his voice secured him a place in a select choir of poor boys at the school at Michaelskirche, L\u00fcneburg.\\nHis voice must have broken soon after this, but he remained at L\u00fcneburg for a time, making himself generally useful. No doubt he studied in the school library, which had a large and up-to-date collection of church music; he probably heard Georg B\u00f6hm, organist of the Johanniskirche; and he visited Hamburg to hear the renowned organist and composer Johann Adam Reinken at the Katharinenkirche, contriving also to hear the French orchestra maintained by the duke of Celle.\\nHe seems to have returned to Thuringia in the late summer of 1702. By this time he was already a reasonably proficient organist. His experience at L\u00fcneburg, if not at Ohrdruf, had turned him away from the secular string-playing tradition of his immediate ancestors; thenceforth he was chiefly, though not exclusively, a composer and performer of keyboard and sacred music. The next few months are wrapped in mystery, but by March 4, 1703, he was a member of the orchestra employed by Johann Ernst, duke of Weimar (and brother of Wilhelm Ernst, whose service Bach entered in 1708). This post was a mere stopgap; he probably already had his eye on the organ then being built at the Neue Kirche (New Church) in Arnstadt, for, when it was finished, he helped to test it, and in August 1703 he was appointed organist\u2014all this at age 18. Arnstadt documents imply that he had been court organist at Weimar; this is incredible, though it is likely enough that he had occasionally played there.\\n## The Arnstadt period\\nAt Arnstadt, on the northern edge of the Thuringian Forest, where he remained until 1707, Bach devoted himself to keyboard music, the organ in particular. While at L\u00fcneburg he had apparently had no opportunity of becoming directly acquainted with the spectacular, flamboyant playing and compositions of Dietrich Buxtehude, the most significant exponent of the north German school of organ music. In October 1705 he repaired this gap in his knowledge by obtaining a month\u2019s leave and walking to L\u00fcbeck (more than 200 miles [300 km]). His visit must have been profitable, for he did not return until about the middle of January 1706. In February his employers complained about his absence and about other things as well: he had harmonized the hymn tunes so freely that the congregation could not sing to his accompaniment, and, above all, he had produced no cantatas. Perhaps the real reasons for his neglect were that he was temporarily obsessed with the organ and was on bad terms with the local singers and instrumentalists, who were not under his control and did not come up to his standards. In the summer of 1705 he had made some offensive remark about a bassoon player, which led to an unseemly scuffle in the street. His replies to these complaints were neither satisfactory nor even accommodating; and the fact that he was not dismissed out of hand suggests that his employers were as well aware of his exceptional ability as he was himself and were reluctant to lose him.\\nDuring these early years, Bach inherited the musical culture of the Thuringian area, a thorough familiarity with the traditional forms and hymns (chorales) of the orthodox Lutheran service, and, in keyboard music, perhaps (through his brother, Johann Christoph) a bias toward the formalistic styles of the south. But he also learned eagerly from the northern rhapsodists, Buxtehude above all. By 1708 he had probably learned all that his German predecessors could teach him and arrived at a first synthesis of northern and southern German styles. He had also studied, on his own and during his presumed excursions to Celle, some French organ and instrumental music.\\nAmong the few works that can be ascribed to these early years with anything more than a show of plausibility are the Capriccio sopra la lontananza del suo fratello dilettissimo (1704; Capriccio on the Departure of His Most Beloved Brother, BWV 992), the chorale prelude on Wie sch\u00f6n leuchtet (c. 1705; How Brightly Shines, BWV 739), and the fragmentary early version of the organ Prelude and Fugue in G Minor (before 1707, BWV 535a). (The \u201cBWV\u201d numbers provided are the standard catalog numbers of Bach\u2019s works as established in the Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis, prepared by the German musicologist Wolfgang Schmieder.)\\n## The M\u00fchlhausen period\\nIn June 1707 Bach obtained a post at the Blasiuskirche in M\u00fchlhausen in Thuringia. He moved there soon after and married his cousin Maria Barbara Bach at Dornheim on October 17. At M\u00fchlhausen things seem, for a time, to have gone more smoothly. He produced several church cantatas at this time; all of these works are cast in a conservative mold, based on biblical and chorale texts and displaying no influence of the \u201cmodern\u201d Italian operatic forms that were to appear in Bach\u2019s later cantatas. The famous organ Toccata and Fugue in D Minor (BWV 565), !@middle@! written in the rhapsodic northern style, and the Prelude and Fugue in D Major (BWV 532) may also have been composed during the M\u00fchlhausen period, as well as the organ Passacaglia in C Minor (BWV 582), an early example of Bach\u2019s instinct for large-scale organization. Cantata No. 71, Gott ist mein K\u00f6nig (God Is My King), of February 4, 1708, was printed at the expense of the city council and was the first of Bach\u2019s compositions to be published. While at M\u00fchlhausen, Bach copied music to enlarge the choir library, tried to encourage music in the surrounding villages, and was in sufficient favour to be able to interest his employers in a scheme for rebuilding the organ (February 1708). His real reason for resigning on June 25, 1708, is not known. He himself said that his plans for a \u201cwell-regulated [concerted] church music\u201d had been hindered by conditions in M\u00fchlhausen and that his salary was inadequate. It is generally supposed that he had become involved in a theological controversy between his own pastor Frohne and Archdeacon Eilmar of the Marienkirche. Certainly, he was friendly with Eilmar, who provided him with librettos and became godfather to Bach\u2019s first child; and it is likely enough that he was not in sympathy with Frohne, who, as a Pietist, would have frowned on elaborate church music. It is just as possible, however, that it was the dismal state of musical life in M\u00fchlhausen that prompted Bach to seek employment elsewhere. At all events, his resignation was accepted, and shortly afterward he moved to Weimar, some miles west of Jena on the Ilm River. He continued nevertheless to be on good terms with M\u00fchlhausen personalities, for he supervised the rebuilding of the organ, is supposed to have inaugurated it on October 31, 1709, and composed a cantata for February 4, 1709, which was printed but has disappeared.\\n\\n## The Weimar period\\nBach was, from the outset, court organist at Weimar and a member of the orchestra. Encouraged by Wilhelm Ernst, he concentrated on the organ during the first few years of his tenure. From Weimar, Bach occasionally visited Weissenfels; in February 1713 he took part in a court celebration there that included a performance of his first secular cantata, Was mir behagt, also called the Hunt Cantata (BWV 208).\\nLate in 1713 Bach had the opportunity of succeeding Friedrich Wilhelm Zachow at the Liebfrauenkirche, Halle; but the duke raised his salary, and he stayed on at Weimar. On March 2, 1714, he became concertmaster, with the duty of composing a cantata every month. He became friendly with a relative, Johann Gottfried Walther, a music lexicographer and composer who was organist of the town church, and, like Walther, Bach took part in the musical activities at the Gelbes Schloss (\u201cYellow Castle\u201d), then occupied by Duke Wilhelm\u2019s two nephews, Ernst August and Johann Ernst, both of whom he taught. The latter was a talented composer who wrote concerti in the Italian manner, some of which Bach arranged for keyboard instruments; the boy died in 1715, in his 19th year.\\nUnfortunately, Bach\u2019s development cannot be traced in detail during the vital years 1708\u201314, when his style underwent a profound change. There are too few datable works. From the series of cantatas written in 1714\u201316, however, it is obvious that he had been decisively influenced by the new styles and forms of the contemporary Italian opera and by the innovations of such Italian concerto composers as Antonio Vivaldi. The results of this encounter can be seen in such cantatas as No. 182, 199, and 61 in 1714, 31 and 161 in 1715, and 70 and 147 in 1716. His favourite forms appropriated from the Italians were those based on refrain (ritornello) or da capo schemes in which wholesale repetition\u2014literal or with modifications\u2014of entire sections of a piece permitted him to create coherent musical forms with much larger dimensions than had hitherto been possible. These newly acquired techniques henceforth governed a host of Bach\u2019s arias and concerto movements, as well as many of his larger fugues (especially the mature ones for organ), and profoundly affected his treatment of chorales.\\nAmong other works almost certainly composed at Weimar are most of the Orgelb\u00fcchlein (Little Organ Book), all but the last of the so-called 18 \u201cGreat\u201d chorale preludes, the earliest organ trios, and most of the organ preludes and fugues. The \u201cGreat\u201d Prelude and Fugue in G Major for organ (BWV 541) was finally revised about 1715, and the Toccata and Fugue in F Major (BWV 540) may have been played at Weissenfels.\\nOn December 1, 1716, Johann Samuel Drese, musical director at Weimar, died. He was then succeeded by his son, who was rather a nonentity. Bach presumably resented being thus passed over, and in due course he accepted an appointment as musical director to Prince Leopold of K\u00f6then, which was confirmed in August 1717. Duke Wilhelm, however, refused to accept his resignation\u2014partly, perhaps, because of Bach\u2019s friendship with the duke\u2019s nephews, with whom the duke was on the worst of terms. About September a contest between Bach and the famous French organist Louis Marchand was arranged at Dresden. The exact circumstances are not known, but Marchand avoided the contest by leaving Dresden a few hours before it should have taken place. By implication, Bach won. Perhaps this emboldened him to renew his request for permission to leave Weimar; at all events he did so but in such terms that the duke imprisoned him for a month (November 6\u2013December 2). A few days after his release, Bach moved to K\u00f6then, some 30 miles north of Halle.\\n## The K\u00f6then period\\nThere, as musical director, he was concerned chiefly with chamber and orchestral music. Even though some of the works may have been composed earlier and revised later, it was at K\u00f6then that the sonatas for violin and clavier and for viola da gamba and clavier and the works for unaccompanied violin and cello were put into something like their present form. The Brandenburg Concertos were finished by March 24, 1721; in the sixth concerto\u2014so it has been suggested\u2014Bach bore in mind the technical limitations of the prince, who played the gamba. Bach played the viola by choice; he liked to be \u201cin the middle of the harmony.\u201d He also wrote a few cantatas for the prince\u2019s birthday and other such occasions; most of these seem to have survived only in later versions, adapted to more generally useful words. And he found time to compile pedagogical keyboard works: the Clavierb\u00fcchlein for W.F. Bach (begun January 22, 1720), some of the French Suites, the Inventions (1720), and the first book (1722) of Das Wohltemperierte Klavier (The Well-Tempered Clavier, eventually consisting of two books, each of 24 preludes and fugues in all keys and known as \u201cthe Forty-Eight\u201d). This remarkable collection systematically explores both the potentials of a newly established tuning procedure\u2014which, for the first time in the history of keyboard music, made all the keys equally usable\u2014and the possibilities for musical organization afforded by the system of \u201cfunctional tonality,\u201d a kind of musical syntax consolidated in the music of the Italian concerto composers of the preceding generation and a system that was to prevail for the next 200 years. At the same time, The Well-Tempered Clavier is a compendium of the most popular forms and styles of the era: dance types, arias, motets, concerti, etc., presented within the unified aspect of a single compositional technique\u2014the rigorously logical and venerable fugue.\\nMaria Barbara Bach died unexpectedly and was buried on July 7, 1720. About November, Bach visited Hamburg; his wife\u2019s death may have unsettled him and led him to inquire after a vacant post at the Jacobikirche. Nothing came of this, but he played at the Katharinenkirke in the presence of Reinken. After hearing Bach improvise variations on a chorale tune, the old man said, \u201cI thought this art was dead; but I see it still lives in you.\u201d\\nOn December 3, 1721, Bach married Anna Magdalena Wilcken, daughter of a trumpeter at Weissenfels. Apart from his first wife\u2019s death, these first four years at K\u00f6then were probably the happiest of Bach\u2019s life. He was on the best terms with the prince, who was genuinely musical; and in 1730 Bach said that he had expected to end his days there. But the prince married on December 11, 1721, and conditions deteriorated. The princess\u2014described by Bach as \u201can amusa\u201d (that is to say, opposed to the muses)\u2014required so much of her husband\u2019s attention that Bach began to feel neglected. He also had to think of the education of his elder sons, born in 1710 and 1714, and he probably began to think of moving to Leipzig as soon as the cantorate fell vacant with the death of Johann Kuhnau on June 5, 1722. Bach applied in December, but the post\u2014already turned down by Bach\u2019s friend, Georg Philipp Telemann\u2014was offered to another prominent composer of the day, Christoph Graupner, the musical director at Darmstadt. As the latter was not sure that he would be able to accept, Bach gave a trial performance (Cantata No. 22, Jesu nahm zu sich die Zw\u00f6lfe [Jesus Called unto Him the Twelve]) on February 7, 1723; and, when Graupner withdrew (April 9), Bach was so deeply committed to Leipzig that, although the princess had died on April 4, he applied for permission to leave K\u00f6then. This he obtained on April 13, and on May 13 he was sworn in at Leipzig.\\n!@bottom@! He was appointed honorary musical director at K\u00f6then, and both he and Anna were employed there from time to time until the prince died, on November 19, 1728.'",

Engraved into a fireplace mantle is a bronze lion, the animal he adopted as a symbol during his dizzying rise to power. Showing me around the vast second-floor space, Milei gestures to a blown-up photo of the lion, propped on his desk as a totem of his destiny. \u201cHe was waiting for me here,\u201d he says.\\n\\nMilei may be the world\u2019s most eccentric head of state.

The oddities of his campaign often overshadowed the stark austerity program he promoted to pull the country out of its economic crisis. Milei, who has bragged about being a tantric sex guru, brandished a chainsaw at rallies to symbolize his plans to slash government spending, dressed up as a superhero who sang about fiscal policy, and told voters that his five cloned English mastiffs, which he reportedly consults in telepathic conversations, are his \u201cbest strategists.\u201d He pledged to eliminate the nation\u2019s central bank, derided climate change as a socialist conspiracy, and assailed Pope Francis, the first Argentine Pontiff, as a \u201cleftist son of a bitch.\u201d Last November, he won in a landslide.\\n\\nThe unlikely ascendance of a self-described \u201canarcho-capitalist\u201d reflects the strength of a right-wing populist movement that has won elections around the world in recent years. Like his counterparts from Italy to Hungary, Brazil to Peru, the U.S. to India, Milei vowed to dismantle a corruption-riddled state ruled by shadowy elites. \u201cLet it all blow up, let the economy blow up, and take this entire garbage political caste down with it,\u201d he said during the campaign.

So far, he sees signs that his economic \u201cshock therapy\u201d is working. Inflation has slowed for four months in a row. The International Monetary Fund has hailed Argentina\u2019s \u201cimpressive\u201d progress. Two days before we sat down on April 25 for an hour-long interview, he had given an address to the nation celebrating the \u201ceconomic miracle\u201d of the country\u2019s first quarterly budget surplus since 2008. Milei thinks he is pioneering an approach that will become a global blueprint. \u201cArgentina will become a model for how to transform a country into a prosperous nation,\u201d he tells me. \u201cI have no doubt.\u201d\\n\\nOthers do. While Milei vowed the \u201cpolitical caste\u201d would bear the brunt, his austerity measures have pummeled ordinary Argentines. The annual inflation rate is still nearly 300%, among the highest in the world. Many Argentines have been forced to carry bags of cash for even small transactions; some stores have given up on price stickers entirely. Milei\u2019s moves\u2014cutting federal aid, transport and energy subsidies, and getting rid of price controls\u2014have caused living costs to spike. More than 55% of Argentines are mired in poverty, up from 45% in December. Milei may be running out of time before his popular support crumbles. \u201cEverybody knew the cost would be huge,\u201d says Argentina\u2019s Foreign Minister Diana Mondino, a close adviser. \u201cWhat we\u2019re experiencing, nobody likes it. But there\u2019s no other way.\u201d\\n\\nArgentina\u2019s economy has been bad enough for long enough that polls show a majority of the nation\u2019s 46 million people remain willing to give Milei a chance. Yet it\u2019s not clear the iconoclastic new President is interested in forging the political alliances required to push his sweeping structural reforms through Argentina\u2019s legislature. There are also signs that Milei has misread the scope of his mandate. He won by presenting himself as an antidote to political and economic mismanagement. But it\u2019s clear he also sees himself as part of a broader cultural battle. He has embarked on an international speaking tour, casting himself as a global crusader against socialism, attacking everything from gender-equity laws to climate activists. And in a nation still haunted by the legacy of its brutal military dictatorship of the 1970s and \u201980s, Milei\u2019s broadsides against the press and threats against political \u201ctraitors\u201d can take on an authoritarian cast. \u201cMuch of the support for Milei was for his economic program, not his libertarian vision or anti-woke agenda,\u201d says Benjamin Gedan, director of the Wilson Center\u2019s Latin America Program. \u201cBut his view is, \u2018You wanted me, and you got me. And I\u2019ll plow ahead.\u2019\u201d\\n\\nTo meet with Milei, you have to go through the person he calls El Jefe, the boss: his sister. On the day of our interview, Karina Milei, sporting silver sequined flip-flops, guarded the door to the President\u2019s office before allowing me in. Karina, 52, is a former tarot reader who until a few years ago was selling cakes on Instagram. Now she controls which journalists her brother speaks with, which photos of him are released, and, reportedly, what Cabinet ministers are hired and fired. (She declined to be interviewed for this article.) One of Milei\u2019s first acts as President was to change a decree barring relatives from Cabinet positions in order to appoint her General Secretary of the Presidency.\\n\\nMilei\u2019s tight relationship with his sister is an exception. He is said to have few close friends, and is recently single after breaking off a relationship with a glamorous TV actress. Instead, he moved into the presidential residence at Los Olivos with the 200-lb. cloned dogs he calls his \u201clittle four-legged children,\u201d each of them named after a famous economist. \\n\\nRaised in a Buenos Aires suburb, Milei had a troubled childhood. He has said he was physically abused by his father, and declared in TV interviews that he regards his parents as \u201cdead to me.\u201d While he played goalkeeper in a soccer club and sang in a Rolling Stones cover band, classmates mainly remembered him for the furious outbursts that first earned him his nickname.\\n\\nMilei became interested in economic theory during Argentina\u2019s bout with hyperinflation in the 1980s. He spent the next 20 years as an economics professor, publishing dozens of academic papers and serving as a financial analyst for think tanks, banks, and private companies. In 2015, he began to appear on TV as a pundit, becoming notorious for expletive-ridden tirades against the \u201cpolitical caste.\u201d He emerged as a national figure during the COVID-19 pandemic, going viral on TikTok for his rants against government lockdowns. In 2021, he decided to jump into politics. Karina managed his successful campaign for a seat in the lower house of the legislature, which included an ad that showed him destroying a model of the Central Bank with Thor\u2019s hammer. \\n\\nLater that year, the Milei siblings created La Libertad Avanza, a new political coalition, to allow him to run for the presidency. At the time, people close to him said in interviews that Milei, who was rumored to hire mediums to communicate with his deceased pet and dead philosophers, believed that God had told him to run for the presidency. \u201cMilei\u2019s driving force is that he truly believes he\u2019s on a divine mission,\u201d says his biographer Juan Luis Gonz\u00e1lez. At rallies, fans wore hats with the words \u201cThe strengths of the heavens,\u201d a reference to a favorite Bible verse. \u201cI didn\u2019t come here to lead lambs, but to awaken lions,\u201d a leather-clad Milei roared at his events.\\n\\nHe also drew inspiration from outside the country. He pledged to \u201cMake Argentina Great Again,\u201d and his campaign rallies featured posters of Donald Trump and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, along with the Gadsden flags once ubiquitous at Tea Party rallies. Milei channeled widespread anger at Peronism, the left-leaning political movement that has dominated Argentine politics since the 1940s, which championed social justice and workers\u2019 rights but produced an economy that has defaulted on its sovereign debt nine times and owes a staggering $44 billion to the IMF. \u201cHe capitalized on the crisis in the old political order,\u201d says Argentine political consultant Sergio Berensztein.\\n\\nViva la libertad, carajo!\u201d became Milei\u2019s famous rallying cry: \u201cLong live freedom, damn it!\u201d Milei has an absolutist\u2019s faith in free markets: he favors loosening gun restrictions to \u201cmaximize the cost of robbery,\u201d and has said he would support the sale of human organs. \u201cAt first, I told him he would have to take it down a couple of gears,\u201d says Luis Caputo, his Economy Minister. \u201cBut it was amazing how the people responded. After a few months, I told him, \u2018Never mind\u2014actually, take it up even further!\u2019\u201d \\n\\nAs a running mate, Milei chose Victoria Villarruel, a conservative from a military family involved in Argentina\u2019s \u201cDirty War\u201d in the 1970s and \u201980s. During that period, the ruling junta forcibly disappeared, imprisoned, tortured, or killed tens of thousands of suspected dissidents\u2014a dark chapter in the nation\u2019s history that both Villarruel and Milei have downplayed. Milei vowed he would not bow to \u201ccultural Marxism\u201d and criticized public education as \u201cbrainwashing.\u201d The ticket at first drew support from young men who liked his diatribes and social media persona. But faced with the choice between Milei and then Economy Minister Sergio Massa, millions of Argentines were so weary of the economic morass that they were willing to give the outsider a chance. He won with 56% of the vote. \u201cToday one way of doing politics has ended and another !@middle@! begins,\u201d he told supporters. \u201cThere is no way back.\u201d\\n\\nThe new way of politics in Argentina is playing out on Milei\u2019s social media feed. The President often stays up until the early morning hours, scrolling on X, formerly Twitter. He\u2019s so prolific on the platform that an Argentine programmer set up a popular website called \u201cHow many tweets has our President liked today?\u201d On the day we spoke, he liked or retweeted 336 posts, much of it delirious all-caps praise of himself. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t interfere with my job,\u201d says Milei, who tells me he is \u201caddicted to work\u201d and takes breaks only to eat, travel, read economic texts, and play with his dogs in the specially made kennels he had built at the presidential residence.\\n\\nThe administration\u2019s early motto has been \u201cNo hay plata\u201d\u2014There is no money. Milei\u2019s austerity measures caused prices to soar, from transportation and food to health care costs. He told Argentines that the effects of his plan would look like the letter V\u2014a steep economic descent before hitting rock bottom, followed by a sharp rebound. In his interview with TIME, Milei declared the worst part was over. \u201cI said that the road would be tough, but that this time it would be worth it,\u201d he tells me, referring to his inauguration speech, in which he asked the public for patience.\\n\\nBut for many, patience is hard to come by. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to have patience when you have enough to eat,\u201d said Jorge Alvarez, a 62-year-old street vendor who says the rise in bus fare has made it almost pointless to commute to his jewelry stall in central Buenos Aires. \u201cWe all desperately want this to work, but I can\u2019t buy meat anymore,\u201d says Alvarez. \u201cMy son can\u2019t go to physical therapy. I can\u2019t travel to see my parents. These are our lives, and there\u2019s a limit to how much we can take at a time.\u201d\\n\\nThe real test, according to both domestic and foreign analysts and officials, will be whether Milei can advance long-term structural reforms while minimizing the social disruptions and backlash that have sunk previous attempts. Milei\u2019s party represents a small minority in both chambers of Argentina\u2019s legislature. Emergency decrees can go only so far; lasting change will require winning elections and making new allies. That, in turn, requires a deft political touch, which is still not Milei\u2019s strong suit. Since taking office, he has branded lawmakers who disagree with him \u201ctraitors\u201d; called Colombian President Gustavo Petro a \u201cterrorist murderer,\u201d leading Colombia to expel Argentine diplomats; and blasted Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez\u2019s wife as \u201ccorrupt\u201d at a far-right rally in Madrid, prompting the country to recall its ambassador.\\n\\nMilei\u2019s first 100 days came and went without any legislative achievements. An omnibus bill that would have given him sweeping executive powers and included measures ranging from the privatization of state entities to penalties for protesters stalled in committee. \u201cIf they expected that the President would change the way he is, that\u2019s never going to happen,\u201d Manuel Adorni, his exhausted-looking spokesman, told me in his small office in the Casa Rosada, sipping mat\u00e9. Earlier in the day, Adorni had spent his press briefing shooting down questions from reporters about his boss\u2019s mental health, spurred by Milei\u2019s repeated reference to having five dogs, even though one is known to have died years ago. (\u201cIf the President says there are five dogs, there are five dogs, and that\u2019s the end of it.\u201d)\\n\\nThe media is among Milei\u2019s favorite targets. He has shuttered Argentine state news agency T\u00e9lam, the only service that covers and reaches into the country\u2019s provinces, accusing it of being a mouthpiece for leftist propaganda. His open hostility to critical journalists, whom he derided in our interview as \u201cextortionists\u201d and \u201cliars,\u201d is amplified by an aggressive network of online supporters. Many who interact with Milei say he sees the world through the lens of right-wing memes. \u201cThe place in the world where he is comfortable is social media,\u201d says Luc\u00eda Vincent, a political scientist at the National University of San Mart\u00edn. Milei divides the public into two camps, Vincent adds. The first is \u201csupporters who only see your actions as a crusade for good,\u201d she says, \u201cand anyone beyond that border as an enemy who must be exterminated.\u201d\\n\\nOne day in late April, more than a million Argentines took to the streets in what turned into the largest protests of Milei\u2019s presidency. Tens of thousands crowded into the Plaza de Mayo in central Buenos Aires, lifting books above their heads in opposition to the drastic budget cuts to public universities. The sunny day had the atmosphere of a festival, with vendors selling chorip\u00e1n and ice cream, and young demonstrators dancing to Latin rock.\\n\\nAmong the most common signs hoisted by protesters was a simple plea: \u201cCuidemos lo que funciona\u201d (Let\u2019s protect what is working). Budget cuts and ongoing inflation had led university officials to declare a financial emergency, warning they would soon run out of money. At the renowned University of Buenos Aires, hallways were dark; classrooms went without air-conditioning in an effort to save on energy bills. \u201cWe have never experienced this situation before in the last 40 years of democracy,\u201d says the university\u2019s chancellor, Ricardo Gelpi, calling the cuts an \u201cextremely grave situation compromising the future of hundreds of thousands of Argentines.\u201d\\n\\nIt was clear that Milei had touched a third rail of Argentine society, which prides itself on its public higher education. But the President lashed back. In posts on X, he accused the universities of \u201cindoctrination\u201d and tweeted a cartoon of a lion drinking a mug of \u201cleftist tears.\u201d When I raise the protests during our interview, he immediately flashes the fury that first made him famous on television. \u201cAre you then in favor of a group that, because they lost the elections, tries to stage a coup?\u201d Milei asks me, leaning over the table and raising his voice. \u201cThey made up a lie, which led society to march,\u201d he tells me, dismissing the student protests as a cynical ploy by left-wing opponents. \u201cThose people complaining are the same ones who sank Argentina.\u201d Then he leans back with a placid smile, as if a switch had been flicked. \u201cEverything we\u2019re accused of is false.\u201d\\n\\n\\nThe realities of the office have prompted Milei to ease off a few of the targets of his ire. Backpedaling from his broadsides against Pope Francis, who is widely beloved in the predominantly Catholic country, Milei visited him in Rome with alfajores cookies. During our interview, Milei seemed to soften several key campaign positions, including plans to replace the peso with the dollar and refuse to do business with China\u2019s \u201ccommunist assassin\u201d regime\u2014a policy evolution that likely owes to Argentina\u2019s dependence on Chinese investment and trade.\\n\\nMilei\u2019s antipathy toward Beijing, which invested heavily in Argentina over the past two decades as part of its bid to exert influence in the region, is a break from his predecessors. He withdrew Argentina from a plan to enter the BRICS alliance, which includes Brazil, Russia, India, and China, and instead asked to join NATO as a global partner. Despite their obvious differences, the Biden Administration has scrambled to seize the opportunity to forge ties in a region where China has been ascendant. A parade of high-ranking officials have trekked to Buenos Aires, from Secretary of State Antony Blinken to General Laura Richardson, the U.S. Southern Command chief. In April, the U.S. announced $40 million in foreign military financing. American officials say Milei is surprisingly easy to work with. He is reachable directly on WhatsApp, where he swaps messages freely, exchanging lion emojis with U.S. Ambassador Marc Stanley.\\n\\nMilei has also tempered his prior criticism of President Joe Biden, whom he once labeled a socialist. \u201cGiven my current role, I handle things cautiously,\u201d he says. Yet it\u2019s clear whom he favors in the 2024 elections. In addition to aping Trump\u2019s campaign slogan, Milei has spoken at CPAC and given interviews to right-wing media figures like Tucker Carlson and Ben Shapiro. \u201cPresident!\u201d he shrieked in a video posted of a February encounter with Trump, enveloping him in an ecstatic hug. \u201cI hope to see you again, and the next time I hope you will be President.\u201d For his part, Trump\u2014as he is wont to do\u2014took credit for Milei\u2019s victory. \u201cHe ran as Trump,\u201d the Republican said in December. \u201cMake Argentina Great Again. It was perfect.\u201d\\n\\nBut in important ways, the two men are very different. \u201cMilei is a rigid ideologue, a true believer,\u201d a senior U.S. diplomat told me, \u201cand Trump only believes in himself.\u201d Milei believes he was elected for his promises of a broader cultural revolution, not in spite of them, and he is intent on realizing that mission no matter the political costs. Making the nation \u201cGreat Again\u201d means \u201creturning to those libertarian values that made Argentina a leading global power,\u201d he told me. \u201cThat is my vision.\u201d\\n\\nInstead of traveling to meet other heads of state, Milei has been appearing at international conferences to rail against socialism. At Davos, Switzerland, he warned \u201cthe West is in danger\u201d and accused its leaders of being \u201cco-opted\u201d by \u201cradical feminism\u201d and \u201cneo-Marxists.\u201d He has met twice with Tesla CEO Elon Musk, whom he sees as a prominent ideological ally. \u201cThere\u2019s an economic battle, a political battle, and a cultural battle,\u201d Milei says. \u201cWe believe post-Marxism ... could lead the world to ruin.\u201d But while he relishes his rising international profile, Milei knows his success will be determined at home. On April 30, he notched his first legislative win when a curtailed version of his omnibus bill was approved by the lower house of Congress. \u201cWe strongly believe this is the only way,\u201d Mondino, the Foreign Minister, says of Milei\u2019s severe austerity program. \u201cWhen the French Revolution started, lots of people died. It was chaos. But 15 other countries opened up within 60 years.\u201d\\n\\nSuccess will require Milei to make new allies, including members of the political \u201ccaste\u201d he has spent years railing against, and to maintain public support amid brutal cost-cutting. Unlike perhaps any other leader elected in the wave of right-wing populism that carried Argentina\u2019s anarcho-capitalist leader to power, Milei has shown he will follow through on the radical plans he campaigned on. \u201cThe world is watching,\u201d says Caputo, !@bottom@! the Economy Minister. \u201cBecause if Argentina manages to reverse this, it means that anyone can.\u201d'",

      "user_prompt":"# Dupilumab for COPD with Blood Eosinophil Evidence of Type 2 Inflammation\\n\\n## Abstract\\n### BACKGROUND\\nDupilumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that blocks the shared receptor component for interleukin-4 and interleukin-13, key and central drivers of type 2 inflammation, has shown efficacy and safety in a phase 3 trial involving patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and type 2 inflammation and an elevated risk of exacerbation. Whether the findings would be confirmed in a second phase 3 trial was unclear.\\n### METHODS\\nIn a phase 3, double-blind, randomized trial, we assigned patients with COPD who had a blood eosinophil count of 300 cells per microliter or higher to receive subcutaneous dupilumab (300 mg) or placebo every 2 weeks. The primary end point was the annualized rate of moderate or severe exacerbations. Key secondary end points, analyzed in a hierarchical manner to adjust for multiplicity, included the changes from baseline in the prebronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) at weeks 12 and 52 and in the St. George\u2019s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ; scores range from 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating better quality of life) total score at week 52.\\n### RESULTS\\nA total of 935 patients underwent randomization: 470 were assigned to the dupilumab group and 465 to the placebo group. As prespecified, the primary analysis was performed after a positive interim analysis and included all available data for the 935 participants, 721 of whom were included in the analysis at week 52. The annualized rate of moderate or severe exacerbations was 0.86 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70 to 1.06) with dupilumab and 1.30 (95% CI, 1.05 to 1.60) with placebo; the rate ratio as compared with placebo was 0.66 (95% CI, 0.54 to 0.82; P<0.001). The prebronchodilator FEV1 increased from baseline to week 12 with dupilumab (least-squares mean change, 139 ml [95% CI, 105 to 173]) as compared with placebo (least-squares mean change, 57 ml [95% CI, 23 to 91]), with a significant least-squares mean difference at week 12 of 82 ml (P<0.001) and at week 52 !@top@! of 62 ml (P=0.02). No significant between-group difference was observed in the change in SGRQ scores from baseline to 52 weeks. The incidence of adverse events was similar in the two groups and consistent with the established profile of dupilumab.\\n### CONCLUSIONS\\nIn patients with COPD and type 2 inflammation as indicated by elevated blood eosinophil counts, dupilumab was associated with fewer exacerbations and better lung function than placebo. (Funded by Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals; NOTUS ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT04456673.)\\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive condition that represents a major public health issue owing to its high prevalence and associated high morbidity and mortality.1 Exacerbations of COPD are clinically important events that may accelerate disease progression.2-4 Approximately half of patients with COPD continue to have exacerbations despite maximal standard care with inhaled triple therapy consisting of a glucocorticoid agent, a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA), and a long-acting \u03b2-agonist (LABA).5,6 Thus, prevention of exacerbations is an important goal for new COPD therapeutics, alongside improvement in lung function and health-related quality of life.\\nA subgroup of patients with COPD is characterized by evidence of local and systemic type 2 inflammation.7-16 Type 2 inflammation is regulated by type 2 helper T cells and innate lymphoid cells and driven by inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-4, interleukin-5, and interleukin-13.14\\nDupilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that blocks the interleukin-4 and interleukin-1317,18 pathways and is approved for multiple diseases marked by type 2 inflammation worldwide (indications are country-dependent),19,20 which raises the possibility that it could be effective therapy in patients with COPD characterized by type 2 inflammation. In a previous phase 3 trial, dupilumab was effective in treating patients with COPD and type 2 inflammation; it was associated with a reduction in moderate or severe exacerbations, improvements in lung function and patient-reported health-related quality of life, and a lessening of the severity of symptoms.7 The results of safety analyses were consistent with the known safety profile of dupilumab. We designed the NOTUS trial to confirm the efficacy and safety of dupilumab in patients with COPD and evidence of type 2 inflammation indicated by blood eosinophil count and high exacerbation risk despite the use of inhaled triple therapy.\\n## Methods\\n### TRIAL DESIGN AND OVERSIGHT\\nWe conducted the NOTUS trial, a 52-week phase 3, international, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, at 329 sites in 29 countries. Eligible patients who were receiving triple inhaler therapy were randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive add-on subcutaneous dupilumab at a dose of 300 mg or matched placebo every 2 weeks (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article at NEJM.org). Randomization was stratified according to country, the dose of inhaled glucocorticoid in use at baseline (Table S1), and smoking status at the time of screening. Enrollment of current smokers was capped at 30%.\\nOwing to the positive results of the first phase 3 trial and the high unmet medical need among patients with COPD, we conducted a prespecified interim analysis of the primary end point with the use of all available participant data. The statistical analysis plan (available with the protocol at NEJM.org) prespecified that when the results of the interim analysis were positive, the primary analysis would be performed and the remaining end points would be analyzed in a hierarchical manner to adjust for multiplicity.\\nThe trial was approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities and ethics committees. All patients provided written informed consent. Oversight of the trial was provided by an external independent data and safety monitoring committee, the members of which were unaware of group assignments (see the Supplementary Appendix).\\nThe sponsors, Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, designed the trial and collected and analyzed the data. All the authors had access to the data, contributed to interpretation of the data, and provided input into the drafting of the manuscript and final approval of the manuscript for submission. Medical writing and editorial assistance with an earlier version of the manuscript were provided by a medical writer, in accordance with Good Publication Practice guidelines, who was funded by the sponsors. The authors vouch for the completeness and accuracy of the data and for the fidelity of the trial to the protocol.\\n### PATIENTS\\nPatients 40 to 85 years of age were eligible if they had had physician-diagnosed COPD for at least 12 months and had been receiving background triple inhaler therapy (an inhaled glucocorticoid agent plus LAMA\u2013LABA or LAMA\u2013LABA alone if inhaled glucocorticoid agents were contraindicated) for at least 3 months and at a stable dose for at least 1 month. In the year before screening for eligibility, patients must have had at least two moderate or one severe exacerbation; at least one moderate exacerbation must have resulted in treatment with systemic glucocorticoids, and at least one exacerbation had to occur while the patient was receiving background triple inhaler therapy.\\nPatients were current or former tobacco smokers with a smoking history of at least 10 pack-years. At screening, patients had to have a postbronchodilator ratio of the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) to the forced vital capacity (FVC) of less than 0.70 and a postbronchodilator FEV1 of more than 30% and up to 70% of the predicted normal value. Patients had symptomatic COPD, as indicated by a dyspnea score of at least 2 on the Medical Research Council dyspnea scale (scores ranges from 1 to 5, with higher scores indicating more severe dyspnea), and reported symptoms of chronic bronchitis (chronic productive cough) for 3 months in the year before screening, in the absence of other known causes of chronic cough. Patients with symptomatic COPD are at increased risk for exacerbations and encompass both the chronic bronchitis and emphysema phenotypes.21,22 Patients with investigator-reported emphysema were not excluded.\\nPatients had an absolute blood eosinophil count of at least 300 cells per microliter on at least one analysis during the screening period before randomization. A current diagnosis or a history of asthma was an exclusion criterion. A complete list of inclusion and exclusion criteria are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.\\n### END POINTS\\nThe primary end point was the annualized rate of moderate or severe exacerbations of COPD during the 52-week trial period. Moderate exacerbations were defined as exacerbations that resulted in treatment with a systemic glucocorticoid, antibiotic agent, or both. Severe exacerbations were defined as exacerbations that led to hospitalization or an emergency medical care visit (with observation lasting >24 hours) or that resulted in death.\\n!@middle@! The following end points were corrected for multiplicity in order of hierarchical testing: the change from baseline in the prebronchodilator FEV1 at weeks 12 and 52, the change from baseline in the prebronchodilator FEV1 at weeks 12 and 52 among the patients who had a fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) level at baseline of 20 parts per billion (ppb) or higher, the change from baseline to week 52 in the total score on the St. George\u2019s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ; scores range from 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating a better quality of life; minimum clinically important difference [MCID], 4 points),23 the percentage of patients with a change of 4 points (the MCID) in the SGRQ total score at week 52, the change from baseline to week 52 in the Evaluating Respiratory Symptoms in COPD (E-RS\u2013COPD) total score (scores range from 0 to 40, with lower scores indicating less severe respiratory symptoms), and the annualized rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations among the patients who had a FENO level of 20 ppb or higher. The key safety end points were adverse events and serious adverse events that occurred after initiation of dupilumab or placebo.\\n### STATISTICAL ANALYSIS\\nEfficacy for the primary and week 12 end points was evaluated in the intention-to-treat population (i.e., all the patients who underwent randomization). The week 52 efficacy end points (continuous and proportion types) were analyzed in the intention-to-treat population among the patients who reached trial week 52 at the time of the primary analysis. Safety was evaluated in the safety population (which included all patients who received at least one full or partial dose of dupilumab or placebo) on the basis of all available data at the cutoff date for the primary analysis.\\nWe estimated that a sample of 924 patients (462 in each trial group) would provide the trial with 90% power to detect a between-group difference in the annualized rate of moderate or severe exacerbations of 25% at week 52 at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05. Additional details are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.\\nThe primary end point was analyzed with the use of a negative binomial regression model, with the total number of events occurring during the 52-week trial period as the response variable. Covariates were trial group, geographic region, dose of inhaled glucocorticoid at baseline, smoking status at screening, disease severity at baseline, and number of moderate or severe exacerbation events of COPD within 1 year before trial screening. The natural log of the 52-week duration of follow-up was used as an offset variable.\\nThe key secondary end points were evaluated with the use of a mixed-effect model for repeated measures that included the trial group, geographic region, the dose of inhaled glucocorticoid at baseline, smoking status at screening, visit, trial group\u2013by\u2013visit interaction, baseline value, baseline value\u2013by\u2013visit interaction, and other model-specific factors as covariates. If the primary end point met statistical significance, a hierarchical testing procedure would be used. Additional details of the hierarchical testing procedure and sensitivity and tipping-point analyses are provided in the Supplementary Appendix. The 95% confidence intervals have not been adjusted for multiplicity and should not be used in place of hypothesis testing.\\n##Results\\n### PATIENTS\\nFrom July 2020 through May 2023, a total of 935 patients underwent randomization: 470 to the dupilumab group and 465 to the placebo group (Fig. S2). The demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients at baseline were similar in the two groups (Table 1). The mean (\u00b1SD) age of the patients was 65.0\u00b18.3 years, and 29.5% were current smokers. Nearly all the patients (98.8%) were receiving an inhaled glucocorticoid plus LAMA\u2013LABA. The mean number of moderate or severe exacerbation events in the year before screening was 2.1\u00b10.9. The mean percent of predicted values at baseline for prebronchodilator and postbronchodilator FEV1 were 47.2\u00b113.0% and 50.1\u00b112.6%, respectively.\\n\\nThe mean blood eosinophil count at baseline was 407\u00b1336 cells per microliter, and 39.8% of the patients had a blood eosinophil count of less than 300 cells per microliter at randomization. The mean FENO level at baseline was 24.6\u00b126.0 ppb, and 41.7% of the patients had a FENO level of 20 ppb or higher at baseline (Table 1 and S2). The representativeness of the trial population is shown in Table S3.\\n### PRIMARY END POINT\\nThe annualized rate of moderate or severe exacerbations of COPD was lower in the dupilumab group (0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70 to 1.06) than in the placebo group (1.30; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.60), resulting in a rate ratio of 0.66 (95% CI, 0.54 to 0.82; P<0.001) (Table 2 and Figure 1). Results were similar in prespecified demographic and disease subgroups and in control-based pattern-mixture\u2013model-multiple imputation and tipping-point sensitivity analyses (Tables S4 and S5 and Fig. S3).\\n\\n### SECONDARY AND OTHER END POINTS\\nLung Function\\nChanges from baseline in the prebronchodilator FEV1 during the 52-week trial period are shown in Figure 2. At week 12, the least-squares mean change in the prebronchodilator FEV1 was 139 ml (95% CI, 105 to 173) in the dupilumab group as compared with 57 ml (95% CI, 23 to 91) in the placebo group (least-squares mean difference, 82 ml; 95% CI, 40 to 124; P<0.001). This improvement was sustained through week 52 (least-squares mean difference, 62 ml; 95% CI, 11 to 113; P=0.02) (Table 2 and Figure 2). The results were similar to those in prespecified subgroups and in sensitivity analyses (Tables S6 and S7 and Fig. S4). Changes in other variables of lung function are shown in Figure S5.\\n\\nIn prespecified analyses involving patients with FENO levels at baseline of 20 ppb or higher, the least-squares mean change from baseline in the prebronchodilator FEV1 at week 12 was 221 ml (95% CI, 148 to 294) with dupilumab as compared with 81 ml (95% CI, 8 to 153) with placebo (least-squares mean difference, 141 ml; 95% CI, 58 to 223; P=0.001). There was no significant difference between the groups at 52 weeks, and no further statistical testing was performed according to the hierarchical testing procedure (Table 2).\\nPatient-Reported Outcomes\\nAt week 52, the decrease from baseline in SGRQ total score (indicating improvement) was \u20139.8 points (95% CI, \u201311.6 to \u20138.0) in the dupilumab group and \u20136.4 points (95% CI, \u20138.3 to \u20134.6) in the placebo group (least-squares mean difference, \u20133.4 points; 95% CI, \u20135.8 to \u20130.9) (Table 2 and Fig. S6). SGRQ scores according to domain and from baseline through week 52 are presented in Table S8. At week 52, improvement in the SGRQ total score by at least 4 points (the MCID) occurred in 51.4% of the patients in the dupilumab group and in 46.5% of the patients in the placebo group (odds ratio, 1.16; 95% CI, 0.86 to 1.58) (Table 2). The change from baseline in E-RS\u2013COPD total score at week 52 was \u20132.4 points (95% CI, \u20133.0 to \u20131.8) and \u20131.8 points (95% CI, \u20132.4 to \u20131.2) in the dupilumab and placebo groups, respectively (least-squares mean difference, \u20130.6 points; 95% CI, \u20131.4 to 0.2) (Table 2 and Fig. S6).\\nAdditional End Points\\nThe time to the first moderate or severe exacerbation event for dupilumab as compared with placebo is shown in Figure 1B (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.89). The time to a first severe exacerbation event with dupilumab as compared with placebo (hazard ratio, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.90) as well as other end-point analyses are shown in Tables S9 and S10. The annualized rate of severe exacerbations was 0.07 (95% CI, 0.04 to 0.12) in the dupilumab group and 0.12 (95% CI, 0.07 to 0.22) in the placebo group (rate ratio vs. placebo, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.31 to 1.02). A summary of missing data in end-point analyses that were included in the hierarchical testing procedure is shown in Table S11.\\nBiomarkers of Type 2 Inflammation\\nIn the dupilumab group, levels of IgE and FENO decreased during the 52-week study. Changes from baseline in FENO, total IgE, and blood eosinophil count are shown in Table S12 and Figure S7.\\n### SAFETY\\nThe percentage of patients who had adverse events during the 52-week trial period was similar in the two groups (66.7% in the dupilumab group and 65.9% in the placebo group) (Table 3). The most common adverse events were coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19), !@bottom@! nasopharyngitis, headache, and COPD. Serious adverse events were reported in 13.0% and 15.9% of the patients in the dupilumab and placebo groups, respectively. Adverse events that resulted in death occurred in 2.6% and 1.5% of the patients in the dupilumab and placebo groups, respectively. Adjudicated death from cardiovascular causes occurred in one patient in each group. Adverse events that were classified as major adverse cardiovascular events occurred in 0.6% and 1.5% of the patients in the dupilumab and placebo groups, respectively. Adverse events according to system organ class are shown in Table S13. Persistent antidrug antibody responses were observed in 14 patients (3.0%) in the dupilumab group and in 3 patients (0.7%) in the placebo group.\\n'",

      "user_prompt":"# The weird way language affects our sense of time and space\\n\\n## The languages we speak can have a surprising impact on the way we think about the world and even how we move through it.\\nIf you were asked to walk diagonally across a field, would you know what to do? Or what if you were offered \u00a320 ($23) today or double that amount in a month, would you be willing to wait? And how would you line up 10 photos of your parents if you were instructed to sort them in chronological order? Would you place them horizontally or vertically? In which direction would the timeline move?\\nThese might seem like simple questions, but remarkably, your answers to these questions are likely to be influenced by the language, or languages, you speak.\\nIn our new book, we explore the many internal and external factors that influence and manipulate the way we think \u2013 from genetics to digital technology and advertising. And it appears that language can have a fascinating effect on the way we think about time and space.\\nThe relationship between language and our perception of these two important dimensions is at the heart of a long-debated question: is thinking something universal and independent of language, or are our thoughts instead determined by it? !@top@! Few researchers today believe that our thoughts are entirely shaped by language \u2013 we know, after all, that babies and toddlers think before they speak. But a growing number of experts believe language can influence how we think just as our thoughts and culture can shape how language develops. \"It actually goes both ways,\" argues Thora Tenbrink, a linguist at Bangor University, in the UK.\\nIt is hard to ignore the evidence that language influences thinking, argues Daniel Casasanto, a cognitive psychologist at Cornell University in the US. For example, we know that people remember things they pay more attention to. And different languages force us to pay attention to an array of different things, be it gender, movement or colour. \"This is a principle of cognition that I don\\'t think anyone would dispute,\" says Casasanto.\\nLinguists, neuroscientists, psychologists and others have spent decades trying to uncover the ways in which language influences our thoughts, often focusing on abstract concepts such as space and time which are open to interpretation. But getting scientific results isn\\'t easy. If we just compare the thinking and behaviour of people who speak different languages, it\\'s hard to be sure that any differences aren\\'t down to culture, personality or something else entirely. The central role that language plays in expressing ourselves also makes it hard to unpick it from these other influences.\\nThere are ways around this conundrum, however. Casasanto, for example, often teaches people in his lab to use metaphors from other languages (in their own tongue) and investigates what impact this has on their thinking. We know that people often use metaphors to think about abstract concepts \u2013 for example, a \"high price\", \"long time\" or \"deep mystery\". This way, you are not comparing people from different cultures, which may influence the results. Instead you are focusing on how thinking changes in the same people from the same culture while speaking in two different ways. Any cultural differences are therefore removed from the equation.\\nCognitive scientist Lera Boroditsky, one of the pioneers of research into how language manipulates our thoughts, has shown that English speakers typically view time as a horizontal line. They might move meetings forward or push deadlines back. They also tend to view time as travelling from left to right, most likely in line with how you are reading the text on this page or the way the English language is written.\\nThis relationship to the direction text is written and time appears to apply in other languages too. Hebrew speakers, for example, who read and write from right to left, picture time as following the same path as their text. If you asked a Hebrew speaker to place photos on a timeline, they would most likely start from the right with the oldest images and then locate more recent ones to the left. \\nMandarin speakers, meanwhile, often envision time as a vertical line, where up represents the past and down the future. For example, they use the word xia (\"down\") when talking about future events, so that \"next week\" literally becomes \"down week\". As with English and Hebrew, this is also in line with how Mandarin traditionally was written and read \u2013 with lines running vertically, from the top of the page to the bottom.\\nThis association between the way we read language and organise time in our thoughts also impacts our cognition when dealing with time. Speakers of different languages process temporal information faster if it\\'s organised in a way that matches their language. One experiment, for example, showed that monolingual English people were quicker to determine whether a picture was from the past or the future (represented by science fiction-style images) if the button they had to press for the past was to the left of the button for future than if they were positioned the other way around. If the buttons were placed above or below each other, however, it made no difference.\\n\\nThings start to get really strange, however, when looking at what happens in the minds of people who speak more than one language fluently. \"With bilinguals, you are literally looking at two different languages in the same mind,\" explains Panos Athanasopoulos, a linguist at Lancaster University in the UK. \"This means that you can establish a causal role of language on cognition, if you find that the same individual changes their behaviour when the language context changes.\"\\nBilingual Mandarin and English speakers living in Singapore also showed a preference for left to right mental time mapping over right to left mental mapping. But amazingly, this group was also quicker to react to future oriented pictures if the future button was located below the past button \u2013 in line with Mandarin. Indeed, this also suggests that bilinguals may have two different views of time\\'s direction \u2013 particularly if they learn both languages from an early age. \\nWe aren\\'t necessarily prisoners to thinking a certain way, though. Intriguingly, Casasanto has shown that you can quickly reverse people\\'s mental time representation by training them to read mirror-reversed text, which goes in the opposite direction to what they\\'re used to. They then react faster to statements that are consistent with time going the opposite way to what they are used to.\\nBut things get even more interesting. In English and many other European languages, we typically view the past as being behind us and the future in front of us. In Swedish, for example, the word for future, framtid, literally means \"front time\". But in Aymara, spoken by the Aymara people who live in the Andes in Bolivia, Chile, Peru and Argentina, the word for future means \"behind time\". They reason that, because we can\\'t see the future, it must be to our rear.\\n\\nIn fact, when the Aymara talk about the future they tend to make backwards gestures, whereas people who speak Spanish, for example, who view the future as being ahead of them, make forwards gestures. Similarly, like the Aymara, Mandarin speakers also imagine the future being behind them and the past ahead of them, calling the day before yesterday \"front day\" and the day after tomorrow \"back day\". Those that speak both Mandarin and English tend to switch between a forward and backward conception of the future, at times in ways that can clash with each other. \\n\\nCasasanto noted that people tend to use spatial metaphors to talk about duration. For example, in English, French, German or the Scandinavian languages, a meeting can be \"long\" and a holiday \"short\". Casasanto showed that these metaphors are more than ways of talking \u2013 people conceptualise \"lengths\" of time as if they were lines in space. He initially believed this was universally true for all people, regardless of the languages they speak. But when presenting his findings at a conference in Greece, he was interrupted by a local researcher who insisted this wasn\\'t correct for her language. \"My first response was a bit dismissive,\" admits Casasanto, who had doubled down on his view. Eventually, though, he says that he \"stopped talking and started listening\". \\nAnd the result changed the course of his research to focus on language-related differences rather than universals in thinking. What he discovered was that Greek people tend to view time as a three-dimensional entity, like a bottle, which can fill up or empty out. A meeting, therefore, isn\\'t \"long\" but \"big\" or \"much\", while a break isn\\'t \"short\" but \"small\".\\nThe same is also true in Spanish.\\n\"I can talk about \\'long time\\' [in English], but if I use this expression in Greek, people will look at me funny,\" explains Athanasopoulos, who is a native Greek speaker. !@middle@! \"They will think I\\'m using it in a poetic way or in a way to emphasise it.\" \\nAthanasopoulos, who found Casasanto\\'s results fascinating, set out to investigate this issue. He sat Swedish and Spanish speakers in front of a computer screen and asked them to estimate how much time had passed when either watching a line grow or a container fill up. The trick was that these events occurred at different rates. Monolingual Swedish speakers were easily misled when the line was shown \u2013 they believed a longer line meant more time had passed, even if that wasn\\'t the case. Their time estimates weren\\'t, however, influenced by a filling container. For Spanish speakers, it was the other way around. \\nAthanasopoulos then went further, looking at bilingual Spanish and Swedish speakers \u2013 and what he found was remarkable. When the Swedish word for duration (tid) appeared in the top corner of the computer screen, the participants estimated time using line length and weren\\'t affected by container volume. But when this changed to the Spanish word for duration (duraci\u00f3n), the results completely reversed. The extent to which the bilinguals were affected by the time metaphors of their second language was related to how proficient they were in that language. \\nThese language quirks are fascinating, but how much impact do they really have on our thinking? Casasanto raises a curious point. When you imagine time on a line, each point is fixed so that two points of time cannot swap places \u2013 there\\'s a strict arrow. But in a container, points of time are floating around \u2013 and potentially capable of swapping places. \"I\\'ve long wondered whether our physics of time might be shaped by the fact that English, German and French speakers were instrumental in creating it,\" he says.\\nInterestingly, time is an increasingly tricky problem in physics, standing in the way of uniting its different branches. Physicists long imagined time as having an arrow, and ticking reliably from the past into the future. But modern theories are more complicated. In Einstein\\'s theory of general relativity, for example, time doesn\\'t seem to flow at all on the grandest scale of the universe \u2013 which is a weird idea even to physicists. Instead, the past, present and future all seem to exist simultaneously \u2013 as if they were points swimming around in a bottle. So perhaps the time as a line metaphor has been \u2013 and still is \u2013 holding back physics. (Read more about whether time goes in just one direction.)\\n\"That would be a pretty remarkable effect of language on thought,\" says Casasanto. \\nLanguages also encode time in their grammar. In English, for example, the future is one of three simple tenses, along with the past and the present \u2013 we say \"it rained\", \"it rains\" and \"it will rain\". But in German, you can say Morgen regnet, which means \"it rains tomorrow\" \u2013 you don\\'t need to build the future into the grammar. The same is true for many other languages, including Mandarin, where external circumstances often denote that something is taking place in the future, such as \"I go on holiday next month\".\\nBut does this affect how we think? In 2013, Keith Chen, a behavioural economist at the University of California, Los Angeles, set out to test whether people who speak languages that are \"futureless\" might feel closer to the future than those who speak other languages. For example, German, Chinese, Japanese, Dutch and the Scandinavian languages have no linguistic barrier between the present and the future, while \"futured languages\", such as English, French, Italian, Spanish and Greek, encourage speakers to view the future as something separate from the present.\\nHe discovered that speakers of futureless languages were more likely to engage in future-focused activities. They were 31% more likely to have put money into savings in any given year and had accumulated 39% more wealth by retirement. They were also 24% less likely to smoke, 29% more likely to be physically active, and 13% less likely to be medically obese. This result held even when controlling for factors such as socioeconomic status and religion. In fact, OECD countries (the group of industrialised nations) with futureless languages save on average 5% more of their GDP per year.\\n\\nThis correlation may sound like a fluke, with complex historical and political reasons perhaps being the real drivers. But Chen has since investigated whether variables such as culture or how languages are related could be influencing the results. When he accounted for these factors, the correlation was weaker \u2013 but nevertheless held in most cases. \"The hypothesis still seems surprisingly robust to me,\" argues Chen. \\nIt is also backed by a 2018 experiment in the bilingual city Meran\/Merano, in northern Italy, where about half the inhabitants speak German, a futureless language, and the other half Italian, a futured language. The researchers tested 1,154 primary school children\\'s ability to resist temptation by asking them whether they would like two tokens (which could be exchanged for presents) at the end of the experiment or a bigger reward (three, four or five tokens) in four weeks.\\nThey discovered that German-speaking children were on average 16 percentage points more likely to be able to wait for a larger number of tokens than Italian-speaking children \u2013 in line with Chen\\'s hypothesis. The results still held when controlling for risk attitudes, IQ, family background and residential area.\\nBut the effects of language can extend even further into our physical world \u2013 influencing how we orient ourselves in space. Different languages can force us to think in terms of specific \"reference frames\". As Boroditsky and her colleague Alice Gaby have shown, Aboriginal Kuuk Thaayorre people in Australia, for example, use cardinal directions \u2013 north, south, east, west \u2013 to talk about even mundane things, such as \"the cup is on your south-west\". This is called an \"absolute\" reference frame \u2013 the coordinates provided are independent of the observer\\'s viewpoint or the location of reference objects.\\nBut many languages, including English, use rather clumsy terms for spatial orientation \u2013 such as \"next to\", \"left of\", \"behind\" or \"above\". As if that wasn\\'t enough, we also have to calculate which frame of reference they apply in. If someone tells you to pick up the keys on the right of a computer, do they mean on the computer\\'s right-hand side or to the right of the computer from your perspective when facing it? The former is called an \"intrinsic\" reference frame (having two reference points: computer and keys) and the latter a \"relative\" reference frame (there are three reference points: computer, keys and observer). \\nAnd this can shape how we think \u2013 and navigate. Tenbrink\\'s and her colleagues have compared the use of reference frames in English and Spanish. In one experiment, she asked people to decide whether an object, say a ball, was left or right of a central figure: an animal, human or object, based on two descriptions given in English or Spanish. For example: \"I see a dog. The ball is on the left of the dog.\" Or: \"I see a dog, the ball is on the dog\\'s left.\"\\nIn English, those two descriptions can denote two different sides of the dog, whereas in Spanish they both refer to what English speakers would think of as the \"dog\\'s left\".\\nSpanish monolinguals located the ball using the intrinsic reference frame 78% of the time and English monolinguals 52% of the time. English speakers only chose the intrinsic frame if the possessive sentence, \"the ball is on the dog\\'s left\", was used. The phrasing didn\\'t matter to Spanish speakers. They simply preferred the intrinsic frame, unless the object was inanimate \u2013 it was a vase or a car rather than a dog, statue or human.\\nIn a follow-up study, Tenbrink showed that bilingual Spanish and English speakers were somewhere in the middle between monolingual Spanish and English speakers, and were more influenced by the reference frame used most commonly in the country they lived in. \"Spanish and English speakers interpret spatial relationships in a slightly different way,\" says Tenbrink. \"And once the speaker speaks both languages, their preferences shift in different ways. I thought that was quite fascinating because people won\\'t normally realise that their preferences shift because they have learned a second language.\" \\nEither way, it\\'s something to keep in mind if you\\'re picking a meeting place with someone who speaks a different language to you.\\nSpeakers of some languages also focus more on actions than the wider context. When watching videos involving motion, English, Spanish, Arabic, and Russian speakers tended to describe what happened in terms of action, such as \"a man walking\". Speakers of German, Afrikaans and Swedish, on the other hand, focused on the holistic picture, including the end point, describing it as \"a man walks towards a car\". \\nAthanasopoulos recalls an incident which laid bare how this can interfere with navigation. While working on a linguistic project, he went for a hike with a group of international researchers in the English countryside. Aiming to get from a town to a small village, they had to get through a private estate by walking across a field, as instructed by a sign with the message: \"Walk across the field diagonally.\" To the English and Spanish speakers, this was intuitive. But a German speaker hesitated, looking slightly confused. When shown the path across the field, at the end of which there was a church, she finally concluded: \"Ah, so you mean we should walk towards the church?\" She needed a start and end point to picture the diagonal the sign was referring to. \\nAs this body of research grows, it is becoming increasingly clear that language is influencing !@bottom@! how we think about the world around us and our passage through it. Which is not to say that any one language is \"better\" than another. As Tenbrink argues, \"a language will develop what its users need\".\\nBut being aware of how languages differ can help you think, navigate and communicate better. And while being multilingual won\\'t necessarily make you a genius, we all can gain a fresh perspective and a more flexible understanding of the world by learning a new language.'",

      "user_prompt":"# China's Yangtze fish-rescue plan is a failure, study says\\n    Five fish species, including the iconic Chinese sturgeon, have gone extinct, or will soon be extinct, because of dams on the Yangtze River in China, according to a paper released on 10 May in Science Advances1. The findings have reignited a long-running debate among Chinese scientists about the best way to rescue the species in the Yangtze, with some saying that the analysis is flawed.\\nThe Yangtze River is a mighty 6,300-kilometre-long waterway and a global biodiversity hotspot that runs through 11 Chinese provinces. !@top@! But over the past 50 years, six major hydropower dams and more than 24,000 smaller hydropower stations have been built in the river\u2019s main stream and branches \u2014 with even more on the drawing board.\\nThe dams were built to help generate electricity, provide flood protection and make the river easier to navigate. But dams can block migratory fishes and damage their habitat. To mitigate the effects of the dams, fish-rescue programmes have been in place in various forms since 1982, when the first dam was being constructed.\\nHuang Zhenli, the deputy engineer-in-chief at the China Institute of Water Resources and Hydropower Research in Beijing, and his colleague Li Haiying developed an analytical tool that models the impact of the Yangtze River dams on its fish populations.\\nThey focused on five iconic species: the Chinese sturgeon (Acipenser sinensis), the Yangtze sturgeon (Acipenser dabryanus), the Chinese paddlefish (Psephurus gladius), the Chinese sucker (Myxocyprinus asiaticus) and the largemouth bronze gudgeon (Coreius guichenoti).\\nBy the time of the analysis, the paddlefish was already extinct. The Yangtze sturgeons are being kept alive only through captive-breeding programmes. The Chinese sturgeon is critically endangered. The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists the sucker as vulnerable, and the gudgeon as endangered.\\nThe researchers\u2019 modelling found that all five species will be entirely extinct or extinct in the wild by 2030.\\nDavid Dudgeon, a retired freshwater ecologist at the University of Hong Kong, says that the study is helpful in identifying the effect of the dams on the five species, particularly the understudied Chinese sucker. \u201cThere is nothing much that surprises me about the conclusions of the study,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is good to see a well-integrated investigation of these five species.\u201d\\nHowever, not all researchers are convinced by the study. Wei Qiwei, a conservation researcher at the Yangtze River Fisheries Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Fishery Sciences, in Wuhan, says that the authors\u2019 work \u201cdeserves to be encouraged\u201d, but disagrees with their conclusions.\\nWei \u2014 who co-authored a 2020 paper2 that declared the Chinese paddlefish extinct \u2014 says the predictions that all species will be extinct or near extinct in by 2030 can\u2019t be relied on because the parameters in the analysis are uncertain and difficult to quantify.\\nXie Ping, a freshwater ecologist at the Institute of Hydrobiology (IHB) of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Wuhan, agrees that it might be too soon to draw definitive conclusions from the models\u2019 findings. \u201cMore needs to be done to cover more fish species in more geographic regions, so as to validate the effectiveness of the models and to optimize their parameters,\u201d Xie says.\\n**Six misjudgements**\\nThe authors blame the dams, and the lack of specialized passageways for migratory fish to bypass the dams \u2014 known as fish-ladders \u2014 for the five species\u2019 !@middle@! collapse.\\n\u201cTo prevent more migratory fishes from going extinct in China, [its] dam-related fish-rescue programmes must undergo fundamental changes,\u201d Huang says.\\nAs fish numbers continued to decline from the 1980s onwards, China stepped up its efforts to safeguard the ecology and environment of the Yangtze.\\nIn 2021, it commenced a ten-year fishing ban and increased its restocking of the river with young, captive-bred fish.\\nHowever, the authors say that it was not enough. They describe \u201csix misjudgements\u201d of these fish-conservation campaigns, including that overfishing is the primary cause of the population declines; and that restocking is a \u201cviable strategy\u201d for mitigating the effects of the dams.\\nWei and his team lead the scientific research behind the current conservation plan. He says that the dams\u2019 impacts on fishes exist, but \u201cone cannot ignore other factors\u201d, such as overfishing.\\n\u201cI believe if the 10-year fishing ban had been introduced to the Yangtze River 30 years earlier, the Chinese paddlefish would not be extinct. Nor would the Chinese sturgeon, the Yangtze sturgeon and the Chinese sucker get so close to extinction,\u201d Wei notes.\\nAs for restocking from captive-bred populations, he describes it as \u201cthe most important protection and restoration task\u201d for the Chinese sturgeon and Yangtze sturgeon.\\nA 2023 study led by IHB researchers3 found that a 2017 pilot fishing ban introduced to the Chishui River \u2014 an upstream tributary of the Yangtze \u2014 was \u201can effective measure to facilitate fish resources recovery\u201d.\\nSteven Cooke, a biologist specializing in fish ecology and conservation at the Carleton University in Ottawa, says that science-based restocking can work \u201cquite well\u201d in cases such as the white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) in North America. \u201cBut if the habitat is degraded and fish can\u2019t complete their life cycles, then stocked fish may not survive,\u201d Cooke says.\\nDudgeon, meanwhile, regards the paper\u2019s criticism of restocking of the Yangtze as being \u201cwell-founded\u201d.\\n\u201cThere is absolutely no evidence that sturgeon restocking has enhanced wild populations, despite the release of millions of cultured juveniles \u2026 [and] the fact that the practice has continued for many years,\u201d he says.\\n**Fishway or highway**\\nXie highlights that, for large and long-lived species such as sturgeons, conservation work is \u201cvery hard\u201d.\\nChinese sturgeons feed and grow near the sea when they are young and migrate more than 3,200 kilometres up the Yangtze to reproduce. \u201cThey spent at least 10 to 20 million years adapting to such a cycle,\u201d Xie says, \u201cThey cannot adapt to the huge changes caused by humans within these few decades.\u201d\\nXie says that fish ladders might not be enough to save the sturgeons. \u201cFish passages in Europe and North America are mainly designed for relatively small-sized fishes, such as salmon. But sturgeons are mostly large and need a lot of space to swim in rivers,\u201d Xie says. \u201cLess than 2% of sturgeons are able to successfully navigate through the fish passages in dams,\u201d he says.\\nDudgeon says that, even when fish ladders work, the stillness of the water in the dam might not provide adequate cues to guide the fish upstream to complete their migration.\\nOn the downstream journey, both adult and juvenile fish have to find a way to navigate the dam, locate the fish ladder and make a safe descent, he adds.\\nSome countries, such as the United States, France and the United Kingdom, have started to dismantle dams to re-establish migration corridors. When removal is not feasible, or fish ladders are ineffective, Xie and his colleagues suggested in a 2023 paper4 that building river-like side channels around hydropower dams is \u201cthe best way\u201d to restore sturgeon migration routes and provide alternative habitats. Successful such cases !@bottom@! have been observed in Russia, Canada and the United States, they noted.\\nDudgeon says that, with so many complications, improving the situation for fishes in the Yangtze \u201cwill be challenging\u201d.\\n",

      "user_prompt":"# The ICC\u2019s threat to arrest Binyamin Netanyahu has shocked Israel \\nIt had been expected in Israel for weeks, but the moment was still a shock when it arrived. On May 20th the prosecutor for the International Criminal Court (icc), Karim Khan, announced that he was requesting arrest warrants for Binyamin Netanyahu and Yoav Gallant !@top@!, Israel\u2019s prime minister and defence minister, along with the leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that launched the deadly attack on Israel on October 7th last year, on charges of war crimes.\\nThe prospect of their leaders appearing in the dock along with the perpetrators of a massacre against them is unthinkable for Israelis. But it is a sign of the horror with which many in the world have come to view their government\u2019s devastating war in Gaza. Mr Khan, a British lawyer, issued detailed and lengthy accusations against both sides. He opened with the allegations against the Hamas chiefs, Yahya Sinwar (pictured right), Muhammad Deif and Ismail Haniyeh, detailing the wanton murder, sexual assault and kidnapping of Israeli citizens. But the charges against the Israeli ministers were no less pointed.\\nRead all our coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas\\nMr Khan noted that Israel has the right to protect its citizens, but he accused it of having pursued \u201cstarvation as a method of war\u201d in Gaza. Israel has denied this charge, pointing to the aid convoys that have been allowed through. But this has mainly happened in the last couple of months and under international pressure. There is ample evidence that Israel has closed routes into Gaza and disrupted the supply of humanitarian aid. Earlier in the war Israeli ministers also made clear in public their intention to impose a \u201ctotal siege\u201d on Gaza. Mr Khan has chosen to focus on these war tactics, rather than the bombing of civilian areas. He has also chosen, at least for now, to target Israel\u2019s political leaders rather than the generals of the Israel Defence Forces (idf). Nor did the charge sheet include the allegation of genocide, which is being investigated separately by the International Court of Justice. Mr Khan may be sticking to crimes that are somewhat easier to prove.\\n\\nThis is only a first step. The judges in the icc\u2019s pre-trial chamber must now agree that there is sufficient evidence to issue the arrest warrants. Even if they do, Israel has not ratified the Rome Statute establishing the icc and so is under no legal obligation to hand over its leaders. Mr Sinwar and Mr Deif are hiding somewhere in Gaza and Mr Haniyeh rarely if ever travels to a country which is a party to the treaty. An actual trial in The Hague is extremely unlikely any time soon.\\nBut it is still devastating, far more so for Israel, a country with a democratically elected government and aspirations to be part of the Western world, than for Hamas, a terrorist !@middle@! organisation. Some Western leaders have already criticised the icc for asserting an equivalence between the leaders of Hamas and Israel\u2019s prime minister. However, if the prosecutor\u2019s request is granted by the pre-trial panel, they would be legally bound as signatories to the Rome Statute to arrest Mr Netanyahu, should he travel to their countries.\\nAmerica, which like Israel is not a signatory, has an altogether different dilemma. For months Joe Biden, the president, has both publicly and privately beseeched Mr Netanyahu to allow more aid through and to go to greater lengths to avoid civilian casualties. In recent weeks he has delayed at least one shipment of arms that could be used in the idf\u2019s offensive on the city of Rafah. The icc prosecutor\u2019s claims are in line with the American criticisms, but Mr Biden nonetheless called them \u201coutrageous\u201d. Antony Blinken, the secretary of state, said they were \u201cshameful\u201d. America has a mixed relationship with the court. Donald Trump, Mr Biden\u2019s predecessor (and possible successor), issued sanctions against the icc for investigating allegations of war crimes committed by American troops in Afghanistan. Mr Biden lifted those sanctions and worked with the court on issuing an arrest warrant last year against Vladimir Putin, the president of Russia, for ordering the abduction of Ukrainian children. America\u2019s response this time, however, is shaped by the fact that Israel is one of its closest allies.\\nBack at home, Mr Netanyahu received rare support from his political opponents. \u201cIt is not possible to issue arrest warrants against Netanyahu, Sinwar and Deif,\u201d said Yair Lapid, the leader of the opposition who has called for Mr Netanyahu\u2019s resignation. \u201cThere is no such comparison. We cannot accept it and it is unforgivable.\u201d Benny Gantz, another centrist rival of Mr Netanyahu who on May 18th threatened to leave the war cabinet of which he is a member, also rallied around the prime minister.\\nBut this will almost certainly be short-lived. Israeli security officials have been quietly warning politicians that withholding humanitarian aid early in the war would come back to haunt !@bottom@! Israel. \u201cIt should have been clear they would have to walk back the bombastic statements on besieging Gaza,\u201d said one idf officer. \u201cSo why do it in the first place?\u201d \\n",

It happened at the end of my !@top@! teens.\\n\\nMy grandfather (well, sort of) and I were taking a walk together, along with an old friend of his from the civil service. This was in the closing days of the revolution, so you\\'d still see spouts of unrest every so often. By chance, a gunshot went off at a protest a few streets over as we were crossing the road, and a few horses got frightened. People were pushed around.\\n\\nFunnily, what I remember most vividly about the moment is how utterly undramatic it was. He stumbled, not in the quick, decisive way you\\'d expect, but instead rather slowly and meanderingly. It looked as though he was going to catch himself. I recall the thought that went through my mind: \\'Oh, this isn\\'t serious. I don\\'t need to do anything.\\'\\n\\nThen someone bumped into him at an unlucky angle, and his head cracked against the pavement.\\n\\nAnd then there was shouting, many long conversations in which I said very little, and, eventually, a funeral. The day they held it was perfect and sunny, and by the end, the black dress I wore stunk of sweat from hem to neck. And many, many people spoke to me about how it wasn\\'t my fault, despite me never suggesting otherwise.\\n\\nMy grandfather had already been on his last legs. Dementia had been rotting his mind for years, and he lived as a ghost of his former self, embarrassing at best and terribly destructive at worst. But though the events that followed his death had far graver consequences for me, something in how small the event was lingered. It made me wonder, for the first time, if there was any narrative to reality at all.\\n\\nIt made me feel afraid. Not of dying, but of all my actions and experiences being empty and profane. Neither kind or unkind, nor even productive or destructive. Only events, objects bumping into one another.\\n\\nAnd, like so many other people before me, I started to wonder.\\n\\nWas this really the only way that things could be?\\n\\nOr might it be possible to alter the nature of the world, and attain something truly eternal? To instill a meaning that could never be lost?\\n\\nFrom then on, despite everything I conceptualized myself as wanting, I think what I was really doing was seeking an answer to that question.\\n\\nPredictably, it didn\\'t end well.\\n\\nTime was frozen on the busy highstreet. There was a golden hue to everything, as if the world was preserved in amber, and the air was utterly still and silent. Horses were stopped in mid stride, and flower petals held rigid in mid-descent.\\n\\nWe stood on either side of the carriage, which was presently \\'in motion\\' on the left side of the street, heading towards the upper reaches of the city. If I craned my neck, I could see in through the window, though I didn\\'t need to look in order to know what was inside. !@middle@! There were two people. One was short, with muddy brown hair, and was currently peering down intently at a book.\\n\\nThe other, staring upwards with a vacant expression, was me.\\n\\nTo be more specific, she was me with some minor differences. She was dressed a little differently, in a dark aquamarine wool stola, in contrast to my black dress robe, and her hair was in a much better state, her braids neat and tidy. And while she also looked tired - I couldn\\'t remember the last time I hadn\\'t - it was to a much lesser degree than myself.\\n\\nI wanted to say I pitied her, and I did, in a manner of speaking. But that wasn\\'t the predominant emotion I was feeling.\\n\\nI turned to face the figure on the other side of the carriage. Raindrops hung in the air, their stillness making them look hard, like fragments of glass. My head simply passed through them as it moved. I wasn\\'t really here, after all, so much as \\'here\\' even existed.\\n\\nThey were also a woman, though you wouldn\\'t have been able to tell. Everything beneath the head-area was buried under black fabric, without so much as an inch of flesh visible, and their face was covered by an expressionless, androgynous porcelain mask. Otherwise, the outfit evoked something like a funeral gown, with only subtle frills around the cuffs and hem of the skirt.\\n\\n\"It is done,\" she said, her voice emotionless. \"Everything is ready.\"\\n\\nI nodded, saying nothing.\\n\\n\"I must recite the contract.\"\\n\\n\"Still?\" I glanced downward. \"Even now?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" she said. \"It is obligatory.\"\\n\\nI sighed, just slightly. \"Fine.\"\\n\\nShe reached for her waist, and grasped a scroll of parchment attached to it with a leather buckle, removing and unfurling it before her face. Then, after a moment, she spoke.\\n\\n\"We once more approach the re-enactment of the hour of reckoning,\" she said, \"all factors are set in motion, and the scenario shall commence imminently. The predestined tragedy approaches, but by the grace of the Dying Gods, you have been granted a chance to amend this cruel fate, for yourself and all others.\"\\n\\nI was silent, looking at the ground.\\n\\n\"Understand this: Your role in the scenario has been elevated from that of bystander to that of the heroine, and your victory condition is thus,\" she continued. \"You must ascertain the identity of your opponent, the cause of the bloodshed to follow, and prevent it before it comes to pass. In order to accomplish this goal, you must pay close heed to all which transpires, and use deduction, alongside your skills and past experience of the events to follow. Do you understand your role?\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" I said, muted.\\n\\nIn stories, at absurd moments like these, you were supposed to want to laugh.\\n\\nBut I didn\\'t really feel like it.\\n\\n\"Should you deviate from your role, the scenario will be compromised, and a grave outcome is forewritten. But should you succeed, then you shall open the path to a brighter future.\" She paused for a moment. !@bottom@! \"That is all. Should we begin?\"\\n\\nMy eyes wandered back to the side, and I stared at my other self. At her face, and past the spectacles, the subtle anxiety in her eyes.\\n\\n\"I have a request,\" I said.\\n",

But I did notice the performers, including the first poet to ever present at a Super Bowl, received a lot of buzz.\\n\\nThe Weeknd\u2019s halftime performance \u2013 and his closeup \u2013 was the talk of Twitter, as Super Bowl performances usually are. With his prime time slot and greatest hits montage, he was the biggest hit on social media, with over 821,000 mentions during the game, most of which were quite positive.\\n\\nPoet Amanda Gorman, who gained national recognition at President Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration, received almost 60,000 mentions that were overwhelmingly positive after she read a poem during the pre-game show.\\n\\n## Drake, Disney and Dew\\nOf the dozens of companies that bought ad time during the big game, three won the Twitterverse with the most positively talked about advertisements of the evening.\\n\\nI reached that conclusion by analyzing the volume of tweets that mentioned the company or used a hashtag introduced in the commercial, as well as by examining the sentiment score to see whether the conversation around the ads was positive or negative.\\n\\nOne of the big winners was State Farm\u2019s ads starring Drake, in which the rapper appears as a stand-in for \u201cJake,\u201d who has appeared frequently in the insurer\u2019s advertisements. Over 28,000 tweets mentioned State Farm within 40 minutes of the commercial\u2019s first airing, for a total of 44,000 during the game. \u201cDrake\u201d was a keyword in most of them. Sentiment was very positive for most of the night as people found \u201cDrake from State Farm\u201d funny, until some users brought up the \u201cDrake curse\u201d that is supposedly bad luck for sports teams. !@middle@!\\n\\nDisney\u2019s trailer for its upcoming series \u201cThe Falcon and The Winter Soldier\u201d performed even better, spurring over 100,000 tweets that specifically mentioned the show. Sentiment was also overwhelmingly positive for the show which stars two characters from the Marvel universe, with a score of over 90% throughout the evening.\\n\\nMountain Dew\u2019s ad featuring pro wrestler John Cena driving through a \u201csurreal watermelon-themed amusement park\u201d won the evening on social media. It received over 300,000 mentions, likely driven by the $1 million offered to the first person who tweeted out the correct number of \u201cmajor melon\u201d bottles that appeared in the ad.\\n\\n## A few duds\\nSuper Bowl mainstay Budweiser had a pretty bad night. At first it said it would not buy advertising this year and instead donate the money to coronavirus vaccination awareness efforts. But apparently it changed its mind and ran several ads for Bud Light and Bud Light Seltzer. Mentions of the two beers were under 10,000 and sentiment turned negative after the ads began running.\\n\\nShift4Shop, an e-commerce platform, advertised its partnership with the Inspiration4 civilian mission to space. The ad did not appear to leave much of an impact on Twitter users, however, with fewer than 2,000 tweets during the game \u2013 not much of an effect for the price tag. It reminded me of Quibi\u2019s Super Bowl ad last year which was meant to be the TV streaming app\u2019s debut to the world. It was not well-received, and the company called it quits in December.\\n\\nAnother big loser were advertisements that were \u201cheavy\u201d \u2013 ad jargon for commercials that are overly emotive, such as those referencing weighty events like the pandemic or the Capitol riots. Most Super Bowl advertisers avoided these themes \u2013 opting instead for escapism and nostalgia. And the ones that did go heavy didn\u2019t do well, such as Bass Pro Shops and Cabela\u2019s ad, during which the narrator intoned that \u201cin these trying times we need nature more than ever.\u201d\\n\\nJeep\u2019s ad starring Bruce Springsteen garnered a lot of attention \u2013 20,000 tweets within minutes of its airing after half time \u2013 but most of it negative. Over two minutes, the Boss implores Americans to \u201cmeet in the middle\u201d in a call for unity that some Twitter users described as \u201ctone deaf.\u201d\\n\\n## Honorable mention\\nWhile it didn\u2019t break the internet, vegan food company Oatly\u2019s love-it-or-hate-it ad got a fair amount of attention given how minimilistic it was.\\n\\nIt featured the company\u2019s CEO playing piano in a field and singing about Oatly\u2019s products. People seemed evenly split on whether the ad was good or absolutely horrible \u2013 but it did generate over 16,000 tweets. The negative reaction may have been the company\u2019s plan all along as it immediately began selling T-shirts saying, \u201cI totally hated that Oatly commercial.\u201d\\n\\nThe shirts sold out in five minutes.\\n\\n[You\u2019re too busy to read everything. !@bottom@!

Taizu captured Beijing in 1368, destroying the palaces, sending the Mongolian rulers fleeing and announcing the Ming Dynasty.\\n\\n## Taizu\\nEmperor Taizu\u2019s empire was one of military discipline and respect of authority, with a fierce sense of justice. If his officials did not kneel before him, he would have them beaten.\\n\\nTaizu was considered a suspicious ruler who transformed his palace guard into a form of secret police to root out betrayals and conspiracies. In 1380, he began an internal investigation that lasted 14 years and brought about 30,000 executions.\\n\\nSo deep was his paranoia that he conducted two more such efforts, resulting in another 70,000 killings of government workers, ranging from high government officials to guards and servants.\\n\\n## Ming Dynasty Trade\\nTaizu was succeeded by his 15-year-old grandson, but one of Taizu\u2019s sons, Chengzu, ignited a civil war to take the throne.\\n\\nFrom 1405 to 1433, Chengzu launched ambitious flotillas to expand the Chinese tribute system to other countries, sending ships to India, the Persian Gulf and the east coast of Africa, pre-dating European efforts of similar scope.\\n\\nBy 1557, the tribute system was replaced by maritime trade which saw China exporting silk and allowing a European presence in the empire. This was a time of expansion of cuisine, as food like sweet potatoes and peanuts entered China for the first time.\\n\\nThe period also brought about significant emigration outside of the empire for the merchant class.\\n\\n## Ming Porcelain\\nOne of the best-loved exports of the Ming Dynasty was its porcelain. Created by grinding china-stone, mixing it with china-clay and then baking until translucent, the technique was developed during the Tang Dynasty, but perfected in the Ming era.\\n\\nAn imperial porcelain factory was created in Jingdezhen in 1368 to produce wares for the imperial court. Though various colors might be featured on a piece, the classic Ming porcelain was white and blue.\\n\\nThe Jingdezhen factory became the source of porcelain exports that were extremely popular in Europe, which hoped to replicate the form.\\n\\n## Great Wall of China\\nMaintenance of the Great Wall of China was not consistent throughout the history of China, and by the time of the Ming Dynasty, it required significant repair work.\\n\\nThe Mongols were a constant threat to the citizens of the Ming Dynasty, and the Great Wall was believed to be the most effective defense against invasion. After several clashes, the Mongols captured Emperor Zhengtong in 1449.\\n\\nThe Ming government chose to replace the emperor with his half-brother rather than pay a ransom. The government also decided that restoring the Great Wall to its full glory and power was the best use of their money to effectively protect the Ming empire.\\n\\nZhengtong was later released and eventually sat on the throne again under the name Tianshun.\\n\\n## Matteo Ricci\\nChristian missionaries from Europe also began to enter the country and provided the world with the first glimpses of life in China.\\n\\nMatteo Ricci was a Jesuit priest from Italy who, in 1583, started the first Catholic mission in China. Ricci learned Chinese, translated Chinese classic literature into Latin and wrote a series of books about the country.\\n\\nRicci also translated books by Euclid into Chinese, and those proved to be very popular. Ricci was known for embracing Chinese ways, often dressing in silk robes and going by the name Li !@middle@! Matou. \\n\\n## Ming Dynasty Literature\\nThe Ming Dynasty saw a publishing boom in China, with an avalanche of affordable books being produced for commoners. Reference books were popular, as well as religious tracts, school primers, Confucian literature and civil service examination guides.\\n\\nThere was a sizable market for fiction, especially for stories written in colloquial language. Writer Feng Menglong had a popular series of humorous short stories that featured palace figures and ghosts and sold well among merchants and educated women.\\n\\nPlay scripts sold very well also. One well-regarded playwright was Tang Xianzu, who specialized in social satire and romance.\\n\\nIt was during the Ming Dynasty that full-length novels began to grow in popularity. Many were adaptations of ancient story cycles that had been part of oral traditions for centuries.\\n\\nMany of the best-known Ming era novels were written by unknown authors using a pseudonym, as with the erotic work Jin Ping Mei, translated as both The Plum in the Golden Vase and The Golden Lotus, and written by someone using the pen name Lanling Xiaoxiao Sheng, or \u201cThe Scoffing Scholar of Lanling.\u201d\\n\\nBook illustration also thrived during this period, with printing methods allowing for artists to carve their illustrations on wood blocks for easily reproducible images. Using illustrations was a way that one publisher would make their books distinct from others, since there was an overlap of written content from publisher to publisher.\\n\\n## Fall of the Ming Dynasty\\nMing rule was partly undone by enormous fiscal problems that resulted in a calamitous collapse. Several factors contributed to the financial trouble. The Imperial clan became overstuffed and paying all the clan\u2019s members became a severe burden.\\n\\nMilitary campaigns had also become a significant drain on the empire\u2019s purse, with efforts in Korea and Japan doing the worst damage, as well as the constant costs of defending against insurgents, particularly the Mongols.\\n\\nAn agricultural disaster, the result of the lowest temperatures of the Little Ice Age, also helped deplete funds. A drop in average temperatures resulted in earlier freezes, shortened growing seasons and produced pitiful harvests.\\n\\nThese circumstances lead to famine, which forced starving soldiers to desert their posts and form marauding gangs ravaging the countrysides.\\n\\nBy 1632, the gangs were moving east, and the Imperial military proved incapable of stopping them. Soon after, the country was further decimated by flooding, locusts, drought and disease. Rebellion and riots became commonplace.\\n\\nIn 1642, a group of rebels destroyed the dikes of the Yellow River and unleashed flooding that killed !@bottom@! hundreds of thousands of people. As the social order broke down and smallpox spread, two competing rebel leaders, Li Zicheng and Zhang, took control of separate parts of the country and both declared new dynasties.\\n\\nThe last Ming emperor, Ch\u00f3ngzh\u0113n, committed suicide in 1644. Later that year, the semi-nomadic Manchu people prevailed over the chaos and became the ruling Qing Dynasty.\\n\\n## Sources\\nThe Troubled Empire.

      "user_prompt":"# Element from the periodic table\u2019s far reaches coaxed into elusive compound\\nOne of the rarest and most mysterious elements in the periodic table has finally given up some crucial chemical secrets, eight decades after its discovery. Researchers at Oak Ridge !@top@! National Laboratory in Tennessee have become the first to use radioactive promethium to make a chemical \u2018complex\u2019 \u2014 a compound in which it is bound to a few surrounding molecules. This feat of synthesis enabled the team to study how the element bonds with other atoms in a solution with water. Published today in Nature1, the findings fill a long-standing gap in chemistry textbooks, and could eventually lead to better methods for separating promethium from similar elements in nuclear waste, for example.\\n\\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tour de force,\u201d says Polly Arnold, a chemist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley, California, who was not involved in the research.\\n\\nPromethium is the most elusive member of the lanthanide family, a row of 15 metals marooned in the periodic table\u2019s southern territories. Discovered in 1945, the element was named after the Titan who stole fire from the gods in Greek mythology. Researchers estimate that less than 1 kilogram of it currently exists naturally in the Earth\u2019s crust, and its radiation has previously been harnessed to power pacemakers and spacecraft2.\\nTogether with a couple of other metals, the lanthanides are collectively known as rare-earth elements, and many are prized for their uses in technology, including lasers and powerful magnets. Although many rare-earth elements are \u2014 counter-intuitively \u2014 abundant in Earth\u2019s crust, they are thinly spread and can be difficult to isolate. That\u2019s partly because they share remarkably similar chemistry, which makes it challenging to extract just one lanthanide element and isolate it from the rest.\\n\\nCurrent separation methods often use molecules known as ligands to bind to positively charged lanthanide ions in solution, forming coordination complexes. Chemists can then exploit subtle differences between these complexes to separate them: for example, by selectively washing the complexes out of water using organic solvents. \u201cBut you need lots and lots of repeated separations to get to the pure material,\u201d says Oak Ridge chemist Ilja Popovs, who co-led the research.\\n\\nPromethium has been something of a closed book for researchers working on improved separation methods. Chemists have succeeded at making only a handful of promethium compounds, all of them simple solids such an oxide3 \u2014 !@middle@! but never a complex that shows how promethium might bond to separation ligands in solution.\\n## Promethium surrounded\\nThe Oak Ridge researchers have filled that gap using promethium-147, a radioactive isotope with a half-life of about 2.5 years, which they harvested from waste generated during the production of radioactive plutonium. Like all the other lanthanides, promethium tends to form ions with a triple positive charge.\\n\\nThe team combined these ions with a ligand called bispyrrolidine diglycolamide, which contains three electron-rich oxygen atoms. Three of these ligands hugged each promethium ion, generating complexes with nine promethium\u2013oxygen bonds.\\n\\nUsing X-ray absorption spectroscopy and theoretical simulations, the researchers measured the average length of these bonds. They also found that oxygen forms the bonds by providing pairs of electrons that neatly fill empty energy levels, known as orbitals, around promethium.\\n\\n\u201cIt\u2019s just incredibly difficult, skilful work, and it\u2019s really impressive that they\u2019ve been able to do it,\u201d says Arnold, who studies lanthanides and their heavier cousins, the actinide elements.\\n\\n## Completing the set\\nFinally, to see how their promethium complex stacked up against other lanthanide complexes, the Oak Ridge researchers combined the same ligand with all the other lanthanides. This produced the first complete collection of comparable lanthanide complexes in solution, and revealed how the length of the lanthanide\u2013oxygen bond decreases, from left to right, across the lanthanide series in the periodic table \u2014 a consequence of a well-known effect called the lanthanide contraction.\\n\\nWith every step along the lanthanide series, from lanthanum to lutetium, each element gains one proton and one electron. Protons add to an atom\u2019s nucleus, while electrons add to its orbitals. With lanthanides, the electrons gradually fill up a particular set of electron orbitals known as 4f that are rather diffuse and therefore do not \u2018shield\u2019 the other negatively charged electrons in an atom from the growing positive charge of its nucleus. This allows the nucleus to exert a stronger pull on some orbitals, and contract the atom more than otherwise expected.\\n\\nBecause the ligands in their lanthanide complexes donate electrons to the orbitals of the central ions, the Oak Ridge researchers were able to see this lanthanide contraction in the bond lengths across their newly synthesized collection. They also observed that the decrease in bond length in the earlier part of the series, from lanthanum to promethium, was sharper than in the later part of the series. Although these results are not especially surprising, says Alexander Ivanov, a chemist at Oak Ridge who co-led the work, \u201cit was exciting !@bottom@! to confirm that this lanthanide contraction also exists in solution\u201d.\\n",

Booming construction expected to be major CO2 emitter\\n3. Policy action like building codes could aid green shift\\nLAGOS - As African countries race to build homes for their soaring populations, material shortages and under-investment threaten to limit the scope of a green revolution in the continent\\'s construction industry.\\n\\nThe building boom presents a huge opportunity to turbocharge Africa\\'s clean energy transition by adopting green design techniques and climate-friendly materials to slash the emissions caused by building houses.\\n\\nAbout 70% of the buildings that will exist in Africa in 2040 are yet to be constructed. So making these buildings greener - like building them with renewable materials or making sure they require less energy to run - could have a major climate impact.\\n\\nIt could also determine how protected people are from the effects of the climate emergency, which is sparking longer and more frequent droughts, storms and floods across Africa. \\n\\nBut there are still many challenges to building more sustainably, as Nigerian architect Eshemokhai Akpene found out. \\n\\nWhen he was commissioned to design 60 condo units in a Lagos suburb, he planned to use sustainable materials like timber and weather-resilient clay instead of conventional concrete, which has a heavy carbon footprint.\\n\\nAfter months of searching for local wood, Akpene was forced to commission an Indonesian firm to build whole timber frames for the apartments and fly them in from Bali along with carpenters to install them. It tripled the overall budget.\\n\\n\"Most of the green building materials are imported from overseas, so it is just not a viable option for real estate developers,\" Akpene said.\\n\\nHe said few local carpenters had the skills to make timber for construction and West African loggers were not producing the quantity he would need.\\n\\nAfrica, which accounts for less than 4% of global emissions,  is not alone in facing the challenge of reducing the carbon emitted when making a building. \\n\\nThe global buildings and construction sector is responsible for nearly 40% of carbon emissions, which means the way buildings are designed, constructed and operated will have to change radically if global warming is to be limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\\n\\nCaitlin Wale, founder of African climate tech accelerator Kinjani, said the dominant narrative of Africa being one of the areas worst-hit by climate change could mask the \"huge opportunity\" offered by the continent\\'s building boom. !@middle@!\\n\\nShe said the speed of development meant Africa could rapidly innovate at scale, using the surge in working-age people and abundant natural resources to create new green building materials.\\n\\n\"Just like with the mobile phone, we don\\'t have to go through the landline just because the Global North did it,\" she said.\\n\\n\"We have the potential to grow green from the start.\" \\n\\n## Back to the future\\nNigeria\\'s population is projected to almost double to 400 million by 2050, and already it has a housing deficit of around 28 million units.\\n\\nBut the cutting-edge technologies and processes needed to green the building sector - such as the production of lower-carbon cement - have often been developed by firms based in Europe and North America.\\n\\n\"Even when we set up industries, we import the processes, the technology, and the outcome is therefore better suited to other climes and that\\'s affected the kind of architecture that we get,\" said Ayodele Arigbabu, a member of the Nigerian Institute of Architects.      \\n\\nBefore Nigeria became industrialised at the turn of the 20th century, builders used local materials like red clay bricks instead of concrete, Arigbabu added.\\n\\nThe bricks were more suited to the country\\'s tropical climate than concrete and more weather-resilient, he added. \\n\\nThere are also homegrown innovations in Africa. Wale noted that scientists are developing ways to use mining waste and biochar, produced from heating biomass, as a substitute for cement in concrete.\\n\\nHowever, the problem is financing. She said there isn\\'t a mature investment ecosystem to support startups at each stage of growth, like in Silicon Valley, and different funding mechanisms are needed - from development grants to private investment. \\n\\n## Leading from the top\\nIndustry experts said governments have a key role to play through mandatory building codes and through their large-scale procurement of building materials.\\n\\nBy investing in green alternatives, governments can help drive the industry while also proving new processes are safe and reliable, said Lindsay Rasmussen, a senior associate at Third Derivative, a climate tech accelerator run by the non-profit RMI.\\n\\n\"That takes a lot of risk and liability concerns away from the rest of the industry and the private developers,\" she said.\\n\\nFor example, in India, she said, the government is working on regulations to promote the adoption of \\'LC3\\', or limestone calcined clay cement, which requires fewer materials to be imported and can reduce the emissions associated with cement production by up to 40%.   \\n\\nAkpene, who said Nigeria\\'s government could give tax incentives to local companies manufacturing energy-efficient building materials, agreed that government policy was crucial.\\n\\n\"It has a chain reaction. If the government wants a lot of green architecture, it has to take the lead,\" he said.\\n\\n(Reporting by Bukola Adebayo !@bottom@! in Lagos and Jack Graham in London; Editing by Clar Ni Chonghaile.)\\n'",

      "user_prompt":"# Grammar as a Foreign Language\\n## 3 Experiments \\n### 3.1 Training Data We trained the model described above on 2 different datasets. For one, we trained on the standard WSJ training dataset. This is a very small training set by neural network standards, as it contains only 40K sentences (compared to 60K examples even in MNIST). Still, even training on this set, we managed to get results that match those obtained by domain-specific parsers. \\nTo exceed the previous state-of-the-art, we created another, larger training set of \u223c11M parsed sentences (250M tokens). First, we collected all publicly available treebanks. We used the OntoNotes corpus version 5 [7], the English Web Treebank [8] and the updated and corrected Question Treebank [9].1 Note that the popular Wall Street Journal !@top@! section of the Penn Treebank [10] is part of the OntoNotes corpus. In total, these corpora give us \u223c90K training sentences (we held out certain sections for evaluation, as described below). \\nIn addition to this gold standard data, we use a corpus parsed with existing parsers using the \u201ctri-training\u201d approach of [11]. In this approach, two parsers, our reimplementation of BerkeleyParser [12] and a reimplementation of ZPar [13], are used to process unlabeled sentences sampled from news appearing on the web. We select only sentences for which both parsers produced the same parse tree and re-sample to match the distribution of sentence lengths of the WSJ training corpus. Re-sampling is useful because parsers agree much more often on short sentences. We call the set of \u223c11 million sentences selected in this way, together with the \u223c90K golden sentences described above, the high-confidence corpus. \\nIn earlier experiments, we only used one parser, our reimplementation of BerkeleyParser, to create a corpus of parsed sentences. In that case we just parsed \u223c7 million senteces from news appearing on the web and combined these parsed sentences with the \u223c90K golden corpus described above. We call this the BerkeleyParser corpus.\\n## 3.2 Evaluation \\nWe use the standard EVALB tool2 for evaluation and report F1 scores on our developments set (section 22 of the Penn Treebank) and the final test set (section 23) in Table 1. \\nFirst, let us remark that our training setup differs from those reported in previous works. To the best of our knowledge, no standard parsers have ever been trained on datasets numbering in the hundreds of millions of tokens, and it would be hard to do due to efficiency problems. We therefore cite the semi-supervised results, which are analogous in spirit but use less data. \\nTable 1 shows performance of our models on the top and results from other papers at the bottom. We compare to variants of the BerkeleyParser that use self-training on unlabeled data [15], or built an ensemble of multiple parsers [14], or combine both techniques. We also include the best linear-time parser in the literature, the transition-based parser of [13]. \\nIt can be seen that, when training on WSJ only, a baseline LSTM does not achieve any reasonable score, even with dropout and early stopping. But a single attention model gets to 88.3 and an ensemble of 5 LSTM+A+D models achieves 90.5 matching a single-model BerkeleyParser on WSJ 23. When trained on the large high-confidence corpus, a single LSTM+A model achieves 92.5 and so outperforms not only the best single model, but also the best ensemble result reported previously. An ensemble of 5 LSTM+A models further improves this score to 92.8. \\nGenerating well-formed trees. The LSTM+A model trained on WSJ dataset only produced malformed trees for 25 of the 1700 sentences in our development set (1.5% of all cases), and the model trained on full high-confidence dataset did this for 14 sentences (0.8%). In these few cases where LSTM+A outputs a malformed tree, we simply add brackets to either the beginning or the end of the tree in order to make it balanced. It is worth noting that all 14 cases where LSTM+A produced unbalanced trees were sentences or sentence fragments that did not end with proper punctuation. There were very few such sentences in the training data, so it is not a surprise that our model cannot deal with them very well. \\nScore by sentence length. !@middle@! An important concern with the sequence-to-sequence LSTM was that it may not be able to handle long sentences well. We determine the extent of this problem by partitioning the development set by length, and evaluating BerkeleyParser, a baseline LSTM model without attention, and LSTM+A on sentences of each length. The results, presented in Figure 3, are surprising. The difference between the F1 score on sentences of length upto 30 and that upto 70 is 1.3 for the BerkeleyParser, 1.7 for the baseline LSTM, and 0.7 for LSTM+A. So already the baseline LSTM has similar performance to the BerkeleyParser, it degrades with length only slightly.\\n\\nBeam size influence. Our decoder uses a beam of a fixed size to calculate the output sequence of labels. We experimented with different settings for the beam size. It turns out that it is almost irrelevant. We report report results that use beam size 10, but using beam size 2 only lowers the F1 score of LSTM+A on the development set by 0.2, and using beam size 1 lowers it by 0.5 (to 92.8). Beam sizes above 10 do not give any additional improvements. \\nDropout influence. We only used dropout when training on the small WSJ dataset and its influence was significant. A single LSTM+A model only achieved an F1 score of 86.5 on our development set, that is over 2 points lower than the 88.7 of a LSTM+A+D model. \\nPre-training influence. As described in the previous section, we initialized the word-vector embedding with pre-trained word vectors obtained from word2vec. To test the influence of this initialization, we trained a LSTM+A model on the high-confidence corpus, and a LSTM+A+D model on the WSJ corpus, starting with randomly initialized word-vector embeddings. The F1 score on our development set was 0.4 lower for the LSTM+A model (92.9 vs 93.3) and 0.3 lower for the LSTM+A+D model (88.4 vs 88.7). So the effect of pre-training is consistent but small. \\nPerformance on other datasets. The WSJ evaluation set has been in use for 20 years and is commonly used to compare syntactic parsers. But it is not representative for text encountered on the web [8]. Even though our model was trained on a news corpus, we wanted to check how well it generalizes to other forms of text. To this end, we evaluated it on two additional datasets: QTB 1000 held-out sentences from the Question Treebank [9]; WEB the first half of each domain from the English Web Treebank [8] (8310 sentences). \\nLSTM+A trained on the high-confidence corpus (which only includes text from news) achieved an F1 score of 95.7 on QTB and 84.6 on WEB. Our score on WEB is higher both than the best score reported in [8] (83.5) and the best score we achieved with an in-house reimplementation of BerkeleyParser trained on human-annotated data (84.4). We managed to achieve a slightly higher score (84.8) with the in-house BerkeleyParser trained on a large corpus. On QTB, the 95.7 score of LSTM+A is also lower than the best score of our in-house BerkeleyParser (96.2). Still, taking into account that there were only few questions in the training data, these scores show that LSTM+A managed to generalize well beyond the news language it was trained on. \\nParsing speed. Our LSTM+A model, running on a multi-core CPU using batches of 128 sentences on a generic unoptimized decoder, can parse over 120 sentences from WSJ per second for sentences of all lengths (using beam-size 1). This is better than the speed reported for this batch size in Figure 4 of [18] at 100 sentences per second, even though they run on a GPU and only on sentences of under 40 words. Note that they achieve 89.7 F1 score !@bottom@! on this subset of sentences of section 22, while our model at beam-size 1 achieves a score of 93.7 on this subset.'",

It can also be trained with the press of a button to home in on a specific person\u2019s voice and exclude all other noise.\\n\\nThe researchers are presenting their prototype at a joint meeting of the Acoustical Society of America and the Canadian Acoustical Association this week. The device uses an artificial intelligence system called a neural network that has been trained on many examples of 20 different types of sound, including alarm clocks, crying babies and birdsong. The user can choose to turn on or off each category of sound from an app, allowing it to pass through the headphones or be blocked.\\n\\nThe prototype consists of !@middle@! commercially available headphones with a microphone attached on the outside of the housing that covers each ear. These microphones record ambient sound and pass it to either a small Orange Pi microcontroller or a smartphone on which the neural network runs. This AI then removes unnecessary sounds and transmits the edited audio feed to the headphones. Gollakota says the equipment could be built into a set of headphones.\\n\\nThe technology works in the same way as the AI that was used to isolate individual instruments and voices amid a noisy jumble recorded during work on The Beatles\u2019s 1970 album Let It Be, allowing director Peter Jackson to create the documentary series The Beatles: Get Back.\\n\\nThat process took some time, but this prototype can process audio within just 8 milliseconds \u2013 because the team kept the neural network small and simple enough for a mobile device to run quickly \u2013 to avoid confusing delays between things happening and you hearing them.\\n\\nGollakota says that the effect is like an \u201caudio spotlight\u201d being turned onto a noise source, allowing you to focus intently on it even in chaotic and loud environments.\\n\\n\u201cThis has new capabilities which give more !@bottom@! control to the user. We\u2019re taking the first steps of human acoustic perception augmentation right now,\u201d says Gollakota.\\n",

      "user_prompt":"# Warm ocean tides are eating away at \u2018doomsday glacier\u2019 in Antarctica\\n\\n!@top@! Ocean tides are burrowing beneath a thick sheet of Antarctic ice\u2014dubbed the \u201cdoomsday glacier\u201d for its threat to global sea levels\u2014and melting it from below. The daily intrusions of seawater, detected by satellites, mean the Thwaites Glacier may be disintegrating \u201cmuch faster\u201d than previously thought, scientists say in a study published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\\n\\n\u201cWhat\u2019s novel about this paper is bringing the ocean tides into the picture,\u201d says New York University \\xadoceanographer David Holland, who was not involved in the study. \u201cThe tide is really changing the way the glacier melts.\u201d\\n\\nMelting at Thwaites, an expanse of ice bigger than Florida that stores enough water to raise sea levels by 0.6 meters, already accounts for 4% of global sea level rise. Because the glacier rests on bedrock that dips inland into a deep basin, its underbelly is vulnerable to relatively warm seawater, which melts the ice and, by loosening it from bedrock, hastens its flow into the ocean. And because other West Antarctic glaciers drain into the same basin, scientists believe Thwaites acts as a keystone. Its removal could accelerate the other glaciers\u2019 collapse, potentially unleashing more than 3 meters of global ocean rise in coming centuries. In 2021, researchers noticed fissures on the floating ice at the ocean foot of the glacier, suggesting its crackup may already be underway.\\n\\nBut Thwaites\u2019s remote location, along with thick sea ice in the region, has limited the ability of scientists to examine the glacier up close with sensors, sampling, or undersea vehicles. In the new study, led by glaciologist Eric Rignot of the University of California, Irvine, scientists turned to satellites and a technique called radar interferometry, which can detect millimeter-size changes in surface elevation. The team analyzed radar data collected by the ICEYE satellites, which took snapshots every 3 hours over roughly 4 months in 2023. From the surface displacements, the researchers could glean clues to what was happening 1000 meters !@middle@! below, near the so-called grounding line\u2014the spot where the frozen behemoth detaches from bedrock.\\nThe radar data showed the ice flexing up or down by several centimeters every few hours\u2014movements that indicated massive water pressure from below was \u201cjacking up\u201d the glacier, Rignot says. The grounding line appeared to regularly shift back and forth over a 6-kilometer-long zone, timed with the advance and retreat of the sea tides. The sloshing water means Thwaites has not so much a specific grounding line but a \u201cgrounding zone\u201d roughly 200 square kilometers in size, where the daily incursions are gradually widening an invasion route for the ocean. \u201cThe glacier is more sensitive to ocean water as a result,\u201d he says.\\nThe data also show that, on occasion, the water travels much farther inland under the ice, far past the grounding zone. During the highest spring tide, a water layer between 5 and 10 centimeters thick flowed as far as 12 kilometers inland. Because that flow happened in concert with the tides, researchers concluded it was seawater, not meltwater from the glacier itself, which is several degrees cooler. That distinction is \u201creally valuable,\u201d says glaciologist Twila Moon of the U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center, who did not participate in the study.\\nThe incursions could speed up the retreat of the grounding line, currently about 500 meters per year, and accelerate the ice\u2019s march to the sea. Current computer models that forecast Thwaites\u2019s future do not account for seawater intrusions past the grounding line, and a study a decade ago found they could double the speed of the glacier\u2019s melt, Rignot notes. All of which makes the future of the doomsday glacier look even darker. !@bottom@! \u201cThe projections we\u2019ve had for retreat have been too conservative,\u201d he says.\\n'",

But how can we do that?\\n\\n1. Figure out climate change:\\nThe Earth\u2019s climate has changed and shifted for millions of years. There have been times in the past when it\u2019s been hotter than it is today, and times when it\u2019s been cooler. But there is something different about the past century. As far as we can tell from the geologic record, there has been no time in Earth\u2019s entire history when the climate has warmed so much in such a short amount of time. And we can see the effects of climate change everywhere: more frequent and more severe extreme weather events like tornados and hurricanes; droughts increasing; more varied weather, with seasons beginning to lack regularity; increased glacial melting and sea level rises. While climate change doesn\u2019t necessarily pose an existential threat to human existence, it surely poses a threat to how we like to live our lives in modern society.\\n\\n2. Figure out nukes:\\nAgain, a !@middle@! single nuclear weapon doesn\u2019t pose a threat to all of humanity, but the thousands of warheads in the world right now certainly do. But as time goes on, the chances of one nuclear detonation increases. Just consider all the \u201cnear misses\u201d in recent history, where all-out nuclear war was averted thanks only to the quick thinking and cool headedness of solitary individuals. We can only try our luck for so long. And one accident or mishap can lead to larger scale nuclear conflict (in the aftermath of a single explosion, it\u2019s difficult to tell if it was a rogue actor or an act of war). We need to disarm as much as possible to reduce the risk of catastrophe.\\n\\n3. Figure out asteroids:\\nIf you want to know the dire consequences for ignoring space-borne threats, just ask the dinosaurs how well it worked out for them. !@bottom@! Asteroids and comets have the ability to trigger massive extinction events, wiping out vast numbers of entire species. While these kinds of events are thankfully incredibly rare, the risk they present are dire. For humanity to make it to the long-term, we need to equip ourselves with robust asteroid detection and mitigation strategies (NASA\u2019s recent DART mission is a great place to start).\\n'",

Our goal is to measure offered load, the traffic that is sent to (offered to) each site. During DDoS offered load balloons with a mix of attack and legitimate traffic, and loss upstream of the service means we cannot directly observe true offered load. We later evaluate our approach with real-world DDoS events (\u00a74). \\nIdea: Our insight is that we can estimate true offered load based on changes in some known traffic that actually does arrive at the service, even when there is upstream loss. \\nTo know how much offered load actually arrives at the ser- vice, we need to estimate some fraction of legitimate traffic. We can then observe how much this traffic drops during the attack, inferring upstream loss. Unfortunately, there is no ge- neral way to determine all legitimate traffic, since legitimate senders change their traffic rates, and attackers often make their traffic legitimate-appearing. Our goal is to reliable es- timate some specific legitimate traffic; we describe several sources next. \\nTraffic sources: There are several possible sources of known legitimate traffic\u2014we consider known measurement traffic and regular traffic sources that are heavy hitters [5]. !@middle@!\\nFor DNS, our demonstration application, RIPE Atlas pro- vides a regular source of known-good traffic, sent from many places. RIPE makes continuous traffic from around 10k publicly available vantage points [55]. Each RIPE vantage point queries every 240 s, and there is enough traffic (about 2500 queries\/minute) to provide a good estimate of offered load. (Although RIPE Atlas is specific to DNS, other commer- cial services often have similar types of known monitoring traffic.) \\nTo find the known-good traffic at each site, we use the catchments of RIPE vantage points with pre-deployed RIPE DNS CHAOS queries (one exists for each root DNS IP, such as measurement ID 11309 for A-root). We can also use Verf- ploeter or captured traces in the anycast sites. An advantage of using RIPE traffic is that it does not place any new load on the service. \\nHeavy hitters can provide an additional source of known- good traffic. Many services have a few consistently large- volume users with regular traffic patterns, and while they vary over time, many are often stable. For DNS, we find that most heavy hitters have a strong diurnal variation in rate; we model them with TBATS (Trigonometric seasonality, Box-Cox trans- formation, ARMA errors, Trend and Seasonal) [19] to factor out such known variation. While an adversary could spoof heavy hitters, that requires a large and ongoing investment to succeed. \\nEstimation: Our goal is to estimate offered load, Toffered. We can measure the observed traffic rate, Tobserved, at the ac- cess link. We define \u03b1 as the access fraction\u2014the fraction of traffic that is not dropped. Therefore Tobserved = \u03b1 \u00b7 Toffered . \\nTo estimate the access fraction (\u03b1), we observe that known good traffic has the same loss on incoming links as does other good traffic and attack traffic. !@bottom@!  We estimate the known traffic rate (from RIPE Atlas measurement traffic, or from heavy hitters, or both), as Tknown. Then \u03b1 \u00b7 Tknown,offered = \\nTknown,observed , and our estimate of offered load is T\u02c6offered = Tobserved \u00b7Tknown,offered\/Tknown,observed.\\n'",

In addition, adolescents who show empathy and support toward their friends are more likely to become supportive parents, which may foster empathy in their own !@top@! offspring.\\n## How we did our work\\nThe KLIFF\/VIDA study at the University of Virginia has tracked 184 adolescents for more than 25 years: from age 13 well into their 30s.\\nStarting in 1998, teens came to the university every year with their parents and closest friend, and a team of researchers recorded videos of their conversations. Researchers observed how much empathy the mother showed to her 13-year-old when her teen needed help with a problem. We measured empathy by rating how present and engaged mothers were in the conversation, whether they had an accurate understanding of their teen\u2019s problem, and how much help and emotional support they offered.\\nThen, each year until teens were 19 years old, we observed whether teens showed those same types of empathic behaviors toward their close friends.\\nA decade later, when some of those same teens were starting to have children of their own, we surveyed them about their own parenting. We also asked them about their young children\u2019s empathy. For example, parents rated how often their child \u201ctries to understand how others feel\u201d and \u201ctries to comfort others.\u201d\\nWe found that the more empathic a mother was toward her teenager at age 13, the more empathic the teen was toward their close friends across the adolescent years. Among teens who later had kids themselves, the ones who had shown more empathy for close friends as adolescents became more supportive parents as adults. In turn, these parents\u2019 supportive responses to their children\u2019s distress were associated with reports of their young children\u2019s empathy.\\n## Why it matters\\nThe ability to empathize with other people in adolescence is a critical skill for maintaining good relationships, resolving conflict, preventing violent crime and having good communication skills and more satisfying relationships as an adult. !@middle@!\\nAdults want teens to develop good social skills and moral character, but simply telling them to be kind doesn\u2019t always work. Our findings suggest that if parents hope to raise empathic teens, it may be helpful to give them firsthand experiences of being understood and supported.\\nBut teens also need opportunities to practice and refine these skills with their peers. Adolescent friendships may be an essential \u201ctraining ground\u201d for teens to learn social skills such as empathy, how to respond effectively to other people\u2019s suffering, and supportive caregiving abilities that they can put to use as parents. Our lab\u2019s most recent paper presents some of the first evidence that having supportive teenage friendships matters for future parenting.\\n## What\u2019s next\\nWe\u2019re continuing to follow these participants to understand how their experiences with parents and peers during adolescence might play a role in how the next generation develops. We\u2019re also curious to understand what factors might interrupt intergenerational cycles of low empathy, aggression and harsh parenting. For example, it\u2019s possible that having supportive friends could compensate for a lack of empathy experienced from one\u2019s family.\\n!@bottom@! While it\u2019s true that you can\u2019t choose your family, you can choose your friends. Empowering teens to choose friendships characterized by mutual understanding and support could have long-term ripple effects for the next generation.\\nThe Research Brief is a short take on interesting academic work.\\n'",

Both depictions have garnered criticism, and both debuted at a time when their sitters are facing serious health issues. Charles was diagnosed with cancer earlier this year and stepped away from official duties in February.\\nWhile critics generally agree that Jonathan Yeo\u2019s portrait of Charles resembles the king, some were taken aback by the artwork\u2019s intense red background.

It\u2019s an interpretation,\u201d writes social media user Marie Therese on X. \u201cShe has captured the princess\u2019 expression really well.\u201d\\nIn the past, Uzor has used portraiture to highlight stories of individuals representing the African diaspora and their relationship with Western culture.

Zadie Smith contributes an introduction and the story\u2019s audio edition is read by the actor Bahni Turpin.\\n\\nAccording to Autumn M. Womack, a professor of English and African American Studies at Princeton University (where Morrison taught for years), the author had written short fiction at least since her college years at Howard University and Cornell University, though she never published a story collection. \u201cRecitatif\u201d was included in the 1983 release \u201cConfirmation: An Anthology of African American Women,\u201d co-edited by the poet-playwright Amiri Baraka and now out of print.\\n\\n\u201cOne of the main takeaways from it (\u2018Recitatif\u2019) is that you\u2019ll begin to think of her as someone who experimented with form. You\u2019ll get away from the idea that she was solely a novelist and think of her as someone who was trying all kinds of writing,\u201d Womack said.\\n\\n\u201cRecitatif\u201d refers to a musical expression defined by Merriam-Webster as \u201ca rhythmically free vocal style that imitates the natural inflections of speech,\u201d a style Morrison\u2019s often suggested. The story tells of a series of encounters between Roberta and Twyla, one of whom is Black, the other white, although we are left to guess which is which.\\n\\nThey meet as girls at the St. Bonaventure children\u2019s shelter (\u201cit was something else to be stuck in a strange place with a girl from a whole other race,\u201d remembers Twyla, the story\u2019s narrator). And they run into each other on occasion years later, whether at a Howard Johnson\u2019s in upstate New York, where !@middle@! Twyla was working and Roberta comes in with a man scheduled to meet with Jimi Hendrix, or later at a nearby Food Emporium.\\n\u201cOnce, twelve years ago, we passed like strangers,\u201d Twyla says. \u201cA black girl and a white girl meeting in a Howard Johnson\u2019s on the road and having nothing to say. One in a blue and white triangle waitress hat \u2014 the other with a male companion on her way to see Hendrix. Now we were behaving like sisters separated for much too long.\u201d\\n\\nAs Womack notes, \u201cRecitatif\u201d includes themes found elsewhere in Morrison\u2019s work, whether the complicated relationship between two women that was also at the heart of her novel \u201cSula\u201d or the racial blurring Morrison used in \u201cParadise,\u201d a 1998 novel in which Morrison refers to a white character within a Black community without making clear who it is. Morrison often spoke of race as an invention of society, once writing that \u201cthe realm of racial difference has been allowed an intellectual weight to which it has no claim.\u201d\\n\\nIn her introduction, Smith likens \u201cRecitatif\u201d to a puzzle or a game, while warning that \u201cToni Morrison does not play.\u201d The mystery begins with the opening lines, \u201cMy mother danced all night and Roberta\u2019s was sick: \u201cWell, now, what kind of mother tends to dance all night?\u201d Smith asks \u201cA black one or a white one?\u201d Throughout the story, Morrison will refer to everything from hair length to social status as if to challenge the reader\u2019s own racial assumptions.\\n\\n\u201cLike most readers of \u2018Recitatif,\u2019 I found it impossible not to hunger to know who the other was, Twyla or Roberta,\u201d Smith acknowledges. \u201cOh, I urgently wanted to have it straightened out. Wanted to sympathize warmly in one sure place, turn cold in the other. !@bottom@! To feel for the somebody and dismiss the nobody.\\n\\n\u201cBut this is precisely what Morrison deliberately and methodically will not allow me to do. It\u2019s worth asking ourselves why.\u201d'",

But the scenario could have resulted in a nasty tangle if things had gone differently.\\n\\nAfterwards, Jordan Olthuis \u2013 a professional mountain biker and YouTuber who was filming his ride \u2013 was confused.\\n\\nChatting with fellow riders in the Cypress parking lot, they affirmed that they were riding down a sanctioned downhill trail, Meat Sweats, where hikers aren\u2019t supposed to be.\\n\\n\u201cThat scenario was weird because she kind of felt like she owned the place in a way,\u201d said Olthuis, who\u2019s been biking down North Shore mountains for more than a decade. \u201cShe felt like we don\u2019t belong there.\u201d\\n\\nUsually hikers and bikers are guided by signage at the heads of trails. In this situation, the female hiker had apparently accessed the trail from the bottom, where no signs were at the time.\\n\\nThat\u2019s since been fixed, said Deanne Cote, executive director with the North Shore Mountain Bike Association.\\n\\n\u201cWe were missing key information at the bottom where people would hike up,\u201d she said. \u201cSo we connected with the District of West Vancouver \u2026 and got the ball rolling on, you know, let\u2019s get some better signage down at the bottom to alert people that these are high-speed downhill trails and not the safest place to be to be hiking up.\u201d\\n\\n!@middle@! The signs were installed at the end of February, just days after the close call. In April, Olthuis posted a video of the experience to YouTube, where it\u2019s been viewed around 25,000 times.\\n\\n## Many trail conflicts caused by miscommunication, NSMBA director says\\nFollowing the incident, a local mountain biker also recognized the woman as a dog walker, and reached out to inform her that it\u2019s a legitimate biking trail, Cote said.\\n\u201cA lot of these user conflicts just come down to miscommunication. She may not have known that these trails were sanctioned, even though we\u2019ve had press releases, and there are signs. [But] you can\u2019t always have signage at every single access point,\u201d Cote added.\\n\\nThere\u2019s also been a steep increase in the number of commercial dog walkers on North Shore trails, she said.\\n\\nAnd each trail system has different rules for where dogs can be on and off leash, \u201cwhich I think makes it a bit confusing for people because they just generally don\u2019t know.\u201d\\n\\nFor the most part, interactions between different trail users are positive. To keep things running smoothly, Cote said the NSMBA reminds people to be nice and say hi.\\n\\nWhen it comes to trail etiquette, faster users yield to slower users, she said. It's also important to follow directional signs.\\n\\n\u201cWe are seeing a lot of people travelling up downhill-preferred trails, which is again going to be higher speeds,\u201d Cote said. \u201cSo do pay attention to those trail signs, and don\u2019t be hiking up a downhill-preferred trail, especially during peak times.\u201d\\n\\nAs the weather improves, and days get longer, trail traffic is only going to get worse.\\n\\n\u201cWe all just want to be out there having fun and enjoying nature,\u201d she said. \u201cJust be courteous to the other trail users out there, is what we preach.\u201d\\n\\n## !@bottom@!

      "user_prompt":"# journey of a clever fox\\n\\nOnce upon a time, nestled in the heart of a lush forest, there lived a community of animals of all shapes and sizes. !@top@! Among them was a curious young fox named Reynard, renowned for his cleverness and insatiable thirst for adventure.\\n\\nOne bright morning, as the sun painted the sky with hues of gold and amber, Reynard awoke with a mischievous gleam in his eyes. He had heard whispers among the creatures of a legendary treasure hidden deep within the forest\u2014a treasure rumored to grant its possessor any wish they desired. Unable to resist the allure of such a prize, Reynard set forth on a quest to uncover its secrets.\\n\\nAs he ventured deeper into the forest, Reynard encountered a wise old owl perched atop a towering oak tree. With a twinkle in his eye, Reynard approached the owl and asked, \"Do you know of the treasure hidden within these woods?\"\\n\\nThe owl blinked slowly, its gaze penetrating. \"Yes, young Reynard, I am aware of the treasure you seek,\" he replied solemnly. \"But be warned, the path to its discovery is fraught with peril. Many have embarked on this quest before you, but few have returned.\"\\n\\nUndeterred by the owl\\'s cautionary words, Reynard thanked him and continued on his journey. Along the way, he encountered a family of rabbits, a group of squirrels, and even a majestic stag, each offering their own words of warning and wisdom. But Reynard paid them no heed, his mind consumed by thoughts of the treasure that awaited him.\\n\\nAfter days of wandering through the dense undergrowth, Reynard finally stumbled upon a hidden cave concealed behind a cascading waterfall. With a triumphant grin, he darted inside, his heart racing with anticipation.\\n\\nWithin the cave, Reynard found himself surrounded by glittering jewels and precious artifacts beyond his wildest dreams. But as he reached out to claim his prize, a voice echoed through the darkness, chilling him to the bone.\\n\\n\"Who dares to disturb my slumber?\" boomed a deep, rumbling voice.\\n\\n!@middle@! Trembling with fear, Reynard turned to see a colossal dragon emerging from the shadows, its scales gleaming like molten gold in the dim light.\\n\\n\"I am Reynard, the cunning fox,\" he stammered, trying to muster his courage. \"I seek the treasure rumored to grant any wish.\"\\n\\nThe dragon\\'s eyes narrowed, its gaze fierce and unyielding. \"You seek that which does not belong to you,\" it thundered. \"But I shall grant you a chance to prove your worth. Answer me this riddle, and the treasure shall be yours.\"\\n\\nReynard listened intently as the dragon posed its riddle:\\n\\n\"I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?\"\\n\\nFor a moment, Reynard was stumped, his mind racing to unravel the mystery. But then, a spark of inspiration ignited within him, and he exclaimed with certainty, \"An echo!\"\\n\\nA knowing smile spread across the dragon\\'s face, and with a graceful sweep of its claw, it revealed the true treasure hidden within the cave\u2014a shimmering pool of water that glowed with an otherworldly light.\\n\\n\"You have proven yourself worthy, young Reynard,\" the dragon declared. \"Take this pool of wishes and use it wisely. But remember, true wealth lies not in material possessions, but in the wisdom and kindness we share with others.\"\\n\\nWith a grateful heart, Reynard accepted the dragon\\'s gift and bid farewell to the cave, his mind filled with newfound wisdom and a renewed sense of purpose. And as he journeyed back through the forest, he vowed to use his wishes not for personal gain, but to bring joy and prosperity to all who called the forest !@bottom@! their home.\\n\\nAnd so, the legend of Reynard the clever fox and the treasure of the forest lived on, a timeless tale of adventure, wisdom, and the boundless power of the human spirit.",
